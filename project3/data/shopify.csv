12,shopify,"Hey [r/shopify](https://www.reddit.com/r/shopify/),

Dan here from EZ Order Tracking, a Shopify App that creates a mobile-friendly Order Tracking page on your store.

It's been 5 months since we started building the app and TODAY it is finally available to download on the official [Shopify App Store](https://apps.shopify.com/ezot?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=shopify&amp;utm_campaign=promo-launch).

We decided to build EZ Order Tracking because the current order tracking apps are old and outdated, but most importantly because they **cost a lot**.

You don't have to sell a kidney anymore just to get your very own tracking page, but don't confuse a low price point with less functionality.

# EZ is not just a name, with a few clicks you'll get

1. Get a mobile-optimized order tracking page in less than 60 seconds. **Just install the app, click enable and you are all set.**
2. Easily edit anything on the page. Is your store in French, German, Spanish, or maybe Japanese? **It doesn't matter.** You can edit every little piece of text on your tracking page so it will match with your store's language. But that's not all, you can change the colors as well. Everyone knows that branding is important, so we made it extremely easy to change the color scheme as well.
3. Automatically send emails to your customers when their order status is changing. You can either set the emails inside the app or just connect EZ Order Tracking with Klaviyo.
4. Cross-sell at just the right time. The order tracking page is not just a place for your customers to see where their shipment is at. With the cross-selling functionality, you can show your customers any product of your choice, which will help you get sale after sale.
5. Track orders shipped by 100+ carriers. If you work with a courier company that has more than 2 vans and 4 employees, EZ Order Tracking will work for you.

# We want to help small businesses grow

We ran a pre-launch exclusive right here a few months ago, so if you are one of the early adopters check your email for directions on how to redeem your special plan.

Of course, we wouldn't post in this community without another special promo: install EZOT in the next 30 days and secure the **free forever plan featuring:**

* all current features;
* all upcoming updates;
* track up to 30 orders per month;
* send up to 90 emails per month;

We will keep up the free forever plan until the 25th of March 2021 because of the high costs associated with order tracking. But if you secure yours now you can keep it forever and ever.

All you have to do is go to the [official EZOT listing page on the Shopify App Store](https://apps.shopify.com/ezot?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=shopify&amp;utm_campaign=promo-launch) and install the app. That's it!

# Start for FREE, pay just $4.97/month when you start to grow

**The Start plan - $4.97/month** \- allows you to track up to 80 orders per month and send up to 150 emails per month.

**The Lite plan - $9.97/month** \- allows you to track up to 200 orders per month and send up to 600 emails per month.

**The Plus plan - $19.97/month** \- allows you to track up to 500 orders per month and send up to 1500 emails per month.

Problem:
I started paying for ads, in this case to Facebook and Google. The problem is that I'm spending money but not getting conversions. Facebook all ready gave me 2 customers although not enough to even cover the ads cost. In the Google case I'm spending money, getting some visits, but 0 conversions. I'm running both ads for over a week and questioning myself if I should continue to run them in -, cause the algorithm needs some time to find the perfect customer.

So I would love to hear some advice for that, what I can do to improve the ads and least make them cover the ads costs. If you will need more information feel free to let me know. I would really appreciate the help.

I've been trying to build a shopify website using the editor for my sister's business where she mainly does servivces like eyebrow waxing, bleaching etc and makeup and so on but will also be selling products soon hence why she wants to move to the Shopify platform.

One of the themes has a service list widget (not sure of the terminology?) that you can add to the page but when using other themes they don't seem to have this so I am wondering how exactly Shopify works then... It seems to me that if you want a particular feature on your website you need to choose a template that has that included and that there isn't a standard set provided by Shopify. Is this correct?

Or is Shopify really only meant to be for those selling products that can be shipped rather than for businesses that have clients that come in for services?

I know you can dive into the code but I thought the point of this was to be a more simple service for those without coding ability.

Is there any alternative?

49,shopify,"Hi all

I am trying to design a 5-6 page website hosted on shopify with some semi custom features. I usually just use a shopify template and am limited to what the template offers, but for this website I want some customization that I am sure will require a web designer.

The web designer I am working with currently from the Philippines (he works at my friends company and theyre helping me) has provided me 4 examples on photoshop and I am really not happy with any of them. It looks like a website from 2014-2015 and not one from 2021.

I need a website with custom images made (this is more graphic design based i guess) with 4 custom sections on the homepage like:

Header banner ---&gt; call to action (shop now) ---&gt; 3 clickable images with the 3 product categories ----&gt; 3 custom drawn emoticons showing the products benefit ----&gt; banner image showing more product benefits (no sugar, 0 calorie, etc) ----&gt; one more call to action on an image ----&gt; newsletter signup and then footer links.

Most of this is already possible on a simple free shopify template but I just need a little more customization.

**I also need a website that I can add or remove, or edit a product without having to hire a designer /coder each time (is this possible?)**

Im a bit lost now. Where do I go to hire someone who can actually do a modern website that isnt going to be thousands? are there apps or plugins I can use instead? or maybe even a website that I can select what I want and input code myself?

I'm hoping to get a bit of advice as I'm planning a new project.

I've used Shopify in the recent past for a wholesale store which I built, ran for a while and then sold, and the platform was really good for what we needed.

However, I'm starting a new project which is rather niche, and I'm not sure whether Shopify is the right platform, or whether there's something better I should be looking into.

We've got a database of 50,000,000+ products for sale, but of course I don't want to import all of those into an ecommerce platform (not sure if any of the platforms could handle that!) and I have a custom backend for searching through these products.

**TL;DR - Would it be possible to create a custom interactive UI on a Shopify store, to use our searching API to look through the products in our database, and then create a product on Shopify which the customer can buy?**

E.g. Customer searches our database, chooses the product they want, system creates a new product/order and the user goes to checkout as normal.Separate database with millions of products - is Shopify the right fit?"

I did some research and saw that a lot of people were saying that its not good for scalability and that people should go with platforms like WordPress. Is this true?  I've also heard that SEO on Shopify isn't that good either, is this also true? I'm not  expecting some get rich quick thing but can you make a decent amount of income \~$8000/month from Shopify if for example you were drop shipping products around \~$20 each (granted I put in the effort)? Is it normal to get \~$8000/month  from Shopify or is it unusual? If you don't recommend Shopify, are there  any platforms you'd recommend instead? I know this is a lot questions  but clarification on even just one question would really help. Thanks :)Is Shopify good for scalability in terms of customers?"

63,shopify,"when starting out, the hardest part is getting exposure, building social media presentce, building trust.  getting a sale is not super important is starting out phase

you optimize ads for traffic.  get visitors to see your site.  get your brand out there.  get ig followers, get people talking about youre site

3 months later, optimize for conversions.  because in 3 months you build ig followers, people talking about your brand, awareness

it is easier to get conversions after you have build brand awareness than to attempt to get conversions on day 1.  conisder the first 3 months of building awareness as gateway to conversions later

67,shopify,"Hi everyone! I‚Äôm kinda new to shopify, I‚Äôve only been using it for the past little over a week. I received an order over 4 days ago for $181. For the two items they purchased, they‚Äôre handmade items. I spent almost $70 on the materials needed to order it the day I sold it, and they‚Äôre already on there way to me (they‚Äôre also non refundable.) I also have in my store policies I don‚Äôt offer refunds because of this reason. Buyer emailed me this morning, four days later, saying she wants a refund of the $181. She claimed her daughter used her credit card without her permission. 
This is her exact words:

Good morning. I am emailing in regards to a order my daughter placed WITHOUT my permission. I recently discovered a charge of $181 was made onto my credit card recently. The order number is #1012. This order was done UNAUTHORIZED. I need to have the order cancelled immediately. If you are ‚Äúunable‚Äù to cancel this order I will have to report the entire transaction as fraudulent. The email on the order is my daughters : (removed for privacy of course). Please respond back to me at your earliest convenience  

I‚Äôve never had to deal with this before even though I‚Äôve been a seller on a different platform for a few months. Can buyers really just claim the payment was unauthorized and get their money back, even if they might regret their purchase and are lying?
It concerns me because not only do I order in materials upon receiving an order but I also have dropshipped items. I‚Äôm afraid that I can have a dropshipped item on the way to the buyer already and it can‚Äôt be canceled / stopped in transit leaving me with a mess or buyer not returning the item. I‚Äôm losing $70 out of pocket now because she wants a refund. It may not sound like a lot to some, but I‚Äôm still a very small and new shopify business so it does hurt my business.

How do I go about these situations, especially this one right now?
Any help would be greatly appreciated


UPDATE: I took shooting_star925 and gulrokacus‚Äôs advice and combined them. It ended up scaring her off into just keeping the order placed and apologizing lmao!! she definitely was trying to pull something on me originallyBuyer claims daughter made Unauthorized purchase??"

73,shopify,"Hi, hopefully this sub has an answer because I'm stumped. 

I offer package deals of flowers at my shop. I want to offer products that can be chosen as the ""Standard Package"" where the customer allows me to choose the flower variety OR the ""Personalized Package"" where the customer selects 7 flowers and 2 greens (this will be a little more costly than the standard option due to customization). 

I haven't been able to find a way to make the product page for the ""Personalized Package"" where there are image options within the product page for the customer to select a la carte their chosen flower images/choices to be included in the overall Personalized Package.

131,shopify,"Hello! This is a question for people who are Shopify developers, or at least knowledgeable about having Shopify pull a site's code from Github. I'm a coder by trade, so this will get technical :)

**Problem setup:** I have a local company that sells rugs. Let's pretend it's called Alabama Rug Company (alabamarugs.com). I want to also start New Jersey Rug Company (njrugs.com), Nevada Rug Company (nevadarugs.com), etc. The websites for each are nearly identical, just a bit of the text/images content is different. I'm trying to figure out the best way to be able to make a change to one ""master"" website, and have it propagate to all 3 company websites.

**My questions:**

1. Is it crazy to set up a deployment system that grabs the ""master website"" code, inserts every templated piece of content into it for a given rug company, and then pushes that rug company's version of the site to its own github repo? And Shopify is linked to that github repo separately for each site, ofc.
2. If I buy a template through the Shopify template marketplace, will I have to buy it separately for each site? Or can I just buy it once for the 3 sites, even though they're under separate Shopify accounts? I mean this in the sense of ""is this likely to be cool with Shopify"", not just ""will it  technically work""
3. Is doing this under separate Shopify accounts the best way to go?

135,shopify,"In February 11 orders over the course of 5 days were posted to our Shopify site which initially looked legitimate but turned out to be fraudulent. The orders were for items in our lower price range of offerings and did not attract notice until we received a charge back on the first order.

Normally a charge back can take months to show up but in this instance this one came only 6 days after the order was placed. We contacted the Bill To person who told us that her card info was hacked online, and she had canceled the card three days prior to our receiving the charge back from the bank.

Next we contacted the person on the receiving end who was at a different address and they had indeed ordered the item. 

But not from us, from Ebay!!!

Yikes!!!

The scammer had setup several of our products on Ebay at the lowest price on the internet and had even used our site to compare the price!!! They then get an order from the buyer using Paypal (which cleared in 3 days even though Ebay claims they wait for buyer confirmation) and then move the money out of their account. They then order from our Shopify site using the stolen card info, and the buyers delivery address. 

We handle hundreds of orders per week and had been capturing the transaction at time of order, instead of auth/capture (which we switched too immediately). We then started looking closely at every order and that's when we discovered 10 other suspicious orders, which did turn out to be fraudulent. We returned the money and canceled the orders but not before shipping pushed four of them out the door.

The scammer made a few bucks, we lost a few bucks, but we learned a very valuable lesson.

1. Use AUTH/CAPTURE mode so that you don't lose anything if you find fraud.

2. Check every order closely where the Bill To / Ship To are not the same.

3. Call the bill to address and confirm a legitimate charge, then call the recipient and confirm they ordered from your store.

4. Scan Ebay once a week for your product descriptions and make sure the seller isn't scamming your products for card fraud.

If you want to follow along, you can* [sign up here](https://shopify.dabido.com.au/pdfs) *to be notified about future articles, and also to get a free illustrated PDF file of this post with another guide.*

I made four Shopify stores - the first three were failures, and the last one succeeded. Over time, I used each store as a way to learn more about what works and what doesn‚Äôt. My current main Shopify store pockets me a nice $1000 AUD/fortnight profit (equivalent to about $800 USD) and I now spend one hour a month on it, but to be honest it probably took a few months of dedicated work to get to that point.

In this part of a series of articles I‚Äôll write, I want to give you my full method for finding product market fit ‚Äî in other words, a way to **figure out which products actually sell before you start to spend a whole heap of money on ads**.

Ads are expensive and risky if you‚Äôre not sure what you‚Äôre doing, and I‚Äôve spent literally tens of thousands of dollars on Facebook ads/Google ads/digital agencies before ‚Äî but that was really dumb, because I didn‚Äôt even know what would work before I threw money at advertising. I‚Äôd like for people to avoid my mistakes, here creating the guide I would have wanted when I started.

The first step that worked for me is to **find product market fit before spending money**. Unlike the other Shopify stores where I spent money on ads and hoped for the best, I tested the products for this store *before* starting a store. This is how you can do it too.

# Understanding funnels briefly

A brief important concept to understand is that the value of a customer is directly proportional to the amount of *intent* that they have when visiting your store.

In a very brief and simplified explanation: your *top of funnel (TOFU)* is your least profitable audience, being composed of strangers that find out about your store for the first time. These are people that have never heard of you. But, hopefully, they need what you‚Äôre selling.

After they visit your store page, they become *bottom of funnel*. These people - who will do things like add to cart - are your most profitable audience, and showing them ads to your store eventually gives you the most bang for your buck. You can generally expect that spending $1 on ads here will give you about $2-3 back conservatively.

# Why starting with ads can be wrong

A lot of Shopify gurus recommend starting with Facebook ads. I actively disagree. Facebook Ads is one of the things that requires the most active thought into creation, interpretation, and risk to your wallet. Therefore, a lot of people are led astray into believing this is the answer.

Facebook ads *can* be amazing. Their machine learning can pick out really good customers for you. But I wouldn‚Äôt start there. Before taking a step into ads, **a much safer way is to test product-market fit for free first.** In other words, to figure out if people actually will buy your product *before* you spend money on ads.

# A few shortcuts to thinking about winning products

* What products have you bought in the past?
* What products have you actually found use for?
* What products have a high perceived value but low actual cost? Generally speaking if this cost is $10, then the price I‚Äôm selling for has to be at least $30 ‚Äî in other words, 3x the price. I‚Äôve sold products before that cost me $100 but sold for $220, so therefore a profit margin of $120. The key is to have **enough margin so that when you eventually do spend money on ads, you have a ‚Äúbuffer‚Äù that you can spend on freelancers for automation and - finally - actually make a profit in the end.**

# Achieving product-market fit for free

Facebook Marketplace is a part of the Facebook app where you can buy and sell goods, kind of like eBay but much easier. It‚Äôs only unlocked if you‚Äôve had Facebook for a while, and is accessible via the Marketplace icon. It‚Äôs really easy to sell things on there.

What we‚Äôre going to do is **sell a product on there that you want to eventually sell on your Shopify website**. Now, it‚Äôs great if you can get some sales from there, but the real purpose is to see how many people people message you about your product - because chances are, if people *really* want your product here, then you‚Äôll have a much better time with that product when you eventually spend the effort to put it on a Shopify store.

Here‚Äôs how you tell if you are successful: people will contact you directly on Facebook messenger to ask about your product.

&gt;If you get more than 9 people asking you for your product in 24 hours, that‚Äôs success. For me this has correlated with a roughly 2-3% conversion rate on my website for people that will **buy** that particular product.

It was actually ridiculous when it happened and I knew I was onto something. I got about 20+ conversations from people interested in buying my product over two days.

Because I was pretty excited and wanted to share this, I told this to a friend and **he got 40+ conversations of people asking for a different product in two days.**

This is how you I know I achieved something that looks like **product-market fit**. This method is actually amazing, because it essentially means:

* You can test as many products as you want, for free
* You can experiment with product, pricing, descriptions, and pictures - so if it doesn‚Äôt sell, it is **only** because of one of those four things - and NOT your website
* You find out within 1 or 2 days whether your product will sell. No conversations? Then people won‚Äôt buy it no matter how many tricks you throw in your website

In fact, I actually met up with someone who bought the product in person from me. So it was complete game changer.

# Why this is so powerful

**The best part of this is that if your product** ***doesn‚Äôt*** **sell well on your Shopify store, then it‚Äôs because it‚Äôs not the product but that you can isolate the problem to** ***the traffic or the store page*****.** And there are ways that you can systematically eliminate the issues till it turns into a product page that does actually sell.

# What if I don't use Facebook? 

Trying your product on various free marketplaces like eBay or even Craigslist is another way to do it. The fundamental principle is the same: test it in places where you can get free traffic, and see if it sells. It looks like harder work at the start, but it'll really save you a headache later on. 

# Conclusion

Now that you have this [method of testing products that you can do for free](https://shopify.dabido.com.au/pdfs), finding products that will sell well becomes risk-free. I wish I did this before launching expensive stores that didn‚Äôt work. I even made the mistake of starting a fifth store without this method, and it bombed badly. So don‚Äôt do that. Achieve a mini-success that you can snowball into a significantly greater likelihood of being profitable.How to find winning products WITHOUT spending money: a guide"
154,shopify,"Hi Everyone,

I'm currently scaling my Facebook Ads with a single creative - testing different audiences. Anyways, that Facebook Ad Creative is getting a lot of great engagement with questions from prospects, positive feedback about the video, and then hate...

A lot of ""hate"" comments range from ""you guys are a scam"" or ""don't buy stuff from Facebook bc I've scammed etc"" or straight-up people ""your product is garbage"" (All of which are NOT previous customers).

My business is not the traditional shopify model because I own a boutique with the products I sell online. My boutique has been open for 12 years in California. (Joined e-commerce late in Feb 2020)

Some of the comments are a bit disheartening when none of what they say is true. Again, none of the people are previous customers, any hiccups I've had with customers I promptly fixed email or phone calls.

My question is how do you guys respond to hate comments? Or if you were in my position how would you respond to stuff like this?

Is it an opportunity for PR? Or is it better to hide all the ""hate/scam/garbage"" comments so people who are looking at my comments at a quick glance don't actually think I'm scamming people?

Would love to hear all your opinions and thoughts.Facebook Comments: How to Deal with Hate/Negativity?"

Have to admit that it is growing very slowly. After one year currently every month I receive about 20-25 orders (so roughly $1000). This is based on about 80-120 sessions per day. However I do want to scale it up as fast as possible since I have more time now.

I have been running google shopping which has been okay. However it is impossible for me to scale up shopping traffic very fast. (Is it true that I can only increase the total amount of items to increase shopping traffic? Because I have almost reached the higher bidding price I can afford to keep a reasonable profit.

I have also tried FB ads but ROI is much lower than google. So I stopped it and did not get a chance to scale up.

I'm just not sure is there any other strategy I should think about to increase the traffic while I will still keep profitable? The conversion (although maybe not very high) is there - but what can I do to increase the total visitors? Shall I focus on adding more items (it takes much time as every item was created manually) if both organic and paid source have been tried?

we are the founders of a fashion label. We have decided to sell our entire label for 1200‚Ç¨ because our interest is no longer in fashion and have new ideas that we want to pursue. 

Everything is there and everything is already implemented, the only thing that needs to be planned is production and advertising. Since we have no more interest in it, we would find it a pity if the brand now simply degenerates and bogs down. So we would be happy if someone else would continue it, whose passion is big enough for the industry. 

We still have about 30 shirts ready for sale in stock, labels, stickers, hangtags, size labels, and packaging as well. Our domain and mailbox are still valid for half a year. We have all the print designs, promotional images that have not been released yet, and a completely finished website. Our Instagram account has 11k followers of which about 2.5% are real. We have had several influencer collaborations that had an average of 40K followers. We still have a fully equipped screen printing machine. Our website gets about 250 organic views a month and has top SEO placement. Of course, we will send you all the credentials, files, accounts, etc. with us and work you in for 2-3 weeks if you decide to buy. However, it should actually be faster. 

So if someone is interested in a small and as good as ready label and has enough interest for the brand, then get in touch. We would be very happy to tell you more about everything.

Kind regards:)

Upon receiving the returned item, we found a significant tear in the jacket she ordered.¬†

I also posted this on the Shopify forums but got no answers.

256,shopify,"Had the pleasure of /u/dandemsky joining me on [Pitstop](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/lucas-walkers-pitstop/id1539922392). Dan is the cofounder of Unbound Merino and up until this time last year, they mostly served travelers like me who don't enjoy packing a lot of luggage.

Dan joined to talk about working with suppliers, pivoting, and still creating urgency without relying on discounts exclusively. 

##Episode 1 - Retention Marketing - Listen on [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/episode/41NLGRauESRQDakjr6PFIb?si=eEP6X4osQ42efpxJEblOoA) / [Apple](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/lucas-walkers-pitstop/id1539922392)


* **Know what your business is**, not your sales pitch. ""comfortable travel"" may be out, but Unbound Merino's products are still high quality, and supply has not been disrupted, so the only thing that needed change was the message the customer received
* **Trust and rely on the customers who got you where you are.** They haven't gone away, the consumer information you gathered from them is still valid, so tailor your efforts towards making their relationship with your brand even stronger, and they will continue to support you, financially with sales and dynamically with feedback
* **Recognize that you're not the only company facing difficulties**, and capitalize on the disruption to others. Suppliers may now find themselves with inventory that otherwise would be sold to a competitor, but you may be able to pick up at a discount. See where you can expand your business, purely based on unanticipated availability and sudden absences in the market
* **Embrace the excitement of scarcity.** While a reliable stock is your backbone, unexpected inventory can allow you to surprise your customers with limited special offers and exclusive products. With everyone stuck at home, craving some excitement, even an unexpected, ""while quantities last"" t-shirt can become an event that gets your consumer base talking, and buying
* **Don't abuse your customer's trust with panic-messaging.** If you have a normal pace for seasonal sales, don't disrupt that, you customers look forward to them and rely on them for solid deals. Sending them a barrage of messages about sudden, unannounced sales only weakens that relationship, annoys your customer, and makes your company seem unsure and unstable. Keep a steady hand on the promotional wheel.


## Episode 2 - Creating Urgency - Listen on [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4c4psYkyYXJPbCmanI3MXT?si=RLULUHXzSoOMLSGMUcPfrA) / [Apple](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/lucas-walkers-pitstop/id1539922392)

* **Be open, clear and honest with your customers** about new, unexpected stock as well as retiring stock. A new item is exciting, but many customers become comfortable and reliant on mainstays, and if given fair warning that an item may soon disappear, will rush to grab as many as they can
* **If the item is a limited time offer, make it very clear to the consumer how many are left**, and how much time is left on the clock for them to make a decision. Often the very idea that someone else may have something special or unique is enough to drive others to desire it
* **Let your customers in on the trade secrets and internal knowledge** of your product line for any limited time offers, such as where the mystery item came from or why you're phasing a product out. Allowing your customers to share a sense of identity and pride in your flash sale will lead to them promoting you, free of charge
* **Trust that customers** who took advantage of one special buy-now-before-its-too-late event will eagerly hang around and wait for the next, confident that they have some secret knowledge of how to score the really good deals from their favourite brand

In the next episode, Dan shares how they approached SEO, and why they were willing to wait two years to see the full results.

I run a project at [shopboreal.com](https://shopboreal.com) which is a search engine to find products from hundreds of thousands of independent merchants. My goal is to help merchants get found.

I've been prototyping with a new product I'd like to get people's feedback on. It's called Boreal Community ([shopboreal.com/community](https://shopboreal.com/community)). Bounce rates on stores tend to be quite high, often because visitors don't find what they're looking for (e.g. they search a product and the store doesn't sell it). Instead of having them go back to Google and keep searching, why not partner up with other merchants to direct the visitor to a partner store who does sell the item. In the process making a commission. The landing page has more info and a wireframe of the designs. [shopboreal.com/community](https://shopboreal.com/community)

280,shopify,"I posted this before on another sub, but I‚Äôd also like to share this here. A little background about me, I‚Äôm the marketing manager of a then-startup company turned into a now-growing company. We tried several tools to market our services and some are really just a waste of time and money. It was a long ride, but we finally found the five perfect tools for every marketing savvy out there. 

* [Smartlook](https://www.smartlook.com/)

If you‚Äôre offering services or products like us, Smartlook is a must-have. What it does is it records what the users are clicking and checking out on your website. Smartlook saved our UX designer a lot of times, since he already knows where potential customers encounter problems or has a hard time navigating through by watching the records. 

Aside from that, Smartlook can also track and record a mobile app if you have one. I‚Äôm not that familiar with the process so I really can‚Äôt elaborate. They have pro plans which are really worth it imo. It gives us an idea where to improve and understand our clients better.

* [HubSpot](https://www.hubspot.com/)

I think almost everyone knows what HubSpot is, but it‚Äôs actually the best CRM tool out there. We can easily see the customers who need immediate help and those who we haven‚Äôt followed up by creating tickets. Emails are perfectly laid out, we can see if the client has opened the email, how long it has been since we kept in touch, etc. HubSpot also offers a lot of online courses for free through HubSpot academy, which means you can also help your employees learn a new skill. Hitting two birds with one stone, yes? 

Did I mention that this is free? Oh, yeah. It‚Äôs free. Add-ons? Optional.

* [Canva](https://www.canva.com/)

We have a UX designer on our team but we don‚Äôt expect them to do a graphic designer‚Äôs job. So for our graphic design needs, we use Canva. Canva‚Äôs really helpful in making simple graphic banners to supplement your blogs and newsletters because of their wide-selection of templates. Frankly, we can‚Äôt afford an Adobe subscription, and it will take us a looong time to learn the software. Canva‚Äôs absolutely free, except if you want to go pro. Sweet.

* [Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com/)

Why is this one here, you ask? As much as possible, we want to look credible and precise to our potential clients. Several grammatical errors can make our site look unprofessional and ‚Äúscammy,‚Äù especially when writing marketing copies. I mean, you don‚Äôt want your clients to read ‚ÄúI want to eat dad!‚Äù instead of ‚ÄúI want to eat, dad!‚Äù right? Bad example, but I know you get it! This one‚Äôs also free, but I suggest getting the Premium. You can set the tone there, the style you want to use (like professional, casual, business), and receive better suggestions. Price starts from $12.50/member (3 to 9 members).

* [Airtable](https://airtable.com/)

Airtable is a database platform which your team can edit and update. They have ‚Äúbases‚Äù where you can add specific members of your team and help them focus on a certain project. It‚Äôs really hard to explain how this one works, but you can do whatever you want in it. You can even automate some actions and integrate apps.

It‚Äôs also free, unless you want to go for a pro plan.

Honorable mentions:

Asana - for creating your team‚Äôs tasks

Buffer - for social media management

Unsolicited advice: Don‚Äôt be afraid to try out tools, even if it means wasting a bit of money. There will be lots of trial and errors in this journey, but you have to go through the process of finding out the best tools you can use for the job. These tools are here to make everything easier and less heavy, so they‚Äôre really worth the investment. Cheers!The best 5 marketing tools that worked for our Shopify store"

300,shopify,"Hi. I have a small problem I'm working on that isn't life or death but would help me if I could try to knock it out today. Basically, my boss set up an accordion / FAQ layout app on our Shopify backend for our FAQs page. Creates collapsible blue question bars that open up onto answers - you know the drill. Looks better than what we had before and it also allows you to embed certain categories on other pages on the website besides the FAQ page. The app's called ""Easy FAQ"". Fantastic.

Here's the problem: I need the four blue collapsible menu items to collapse into the category (""Golf Carts""). So before each embedded section, I've put an H2 with that section's title - I want to make that H2 clickable and have it expand onto all of the blue collapsible menu items created by the app. There's no native way to do this with Easy FAQ, I've already spoken to support and they've written that off as impossible. My boss, however, is committed to using the app so I'm stuck working on this problem now. 

I'm going to need to animate this with Javascript but I am but a baby web developer and my knowledge (so far) really only extends into minor JS work, HTML, CSS and a LOT of code bashing, as needed.

I made four Shopify stores - the first three were failures, and the last one succeeded. Over time, I used each store as a way to learn more about what works and what doesn‚Äôt. My current main Shopify store - that I made in 2018 - pockets me a nice $1000 AUD/fortnight profit now (equivalent to about $800 USD) and I now spend one hour a month on it, but to be honest it probably took at least a few months of dedicated work to get to that point even on that one store.

I‚Äôll be writing a series of interconnected articles about the things I learnt along the way, because I figured out my own way of doing it in a way that reduces risk of losing money as much as possible, and gives you feedback along the way so that you can eventually make a profitable store by yourself.

There‚Äôs a lot of ‚Äúif you do this you will make $100,000 online in no time‚Äù stuff on the internet, but I think this often leads people to a rather dangerous path of spending thousands of dollars on e.g. Facebook Ads and then losing it. Please learn from my own mistakes! There‚Äôs a lot of moves that you can make that are lower risk and more likely to succeed than others, so I‚Äôll list my own opinionated version of them here.

# The System

1. **Find product-market fit first without ads.** Ads are expensive and risky. Gurus make it sound straightforward, but ads are honestly really difficult *and you don‚Äôt have to use ads at the beginning*. I personally use Facebook Marketplace to pre-test my products.
2. **Create trust signals to make it safe for customers to purchase.** At the bare minimum, you need:
   1. An About Us page
   2. A Returns Policy
   3. A Shipping page
   4. Ideally, a chatbox to increase trust for your customers / provide support
   5. A positive reviews box
3. **A high converting Shopify page.** The key here is to make sure syou‚Äôre addressing customer‚Äôs intent in as concise a way as possible. To be perfectly honest, the text matters a bit and should obviously be well written in order to confer trust, but **it‚Äôs the pictures that will move someone to buy your product**. I‚Äôve analysed the traffic on my website, and whilst barely anyone scrolls much text beyond the first paragraph or two, *almost everyone* that actually purchases will look at at least three pictures of your product.
4. **Use higher intent traffic.** I personally find Facebook ads is one of the hardest, requiring a lot of data (i.e. money spent) before you can nail down whether something will really work or not. So in my case, I use Google ads.
5. **Capture much more value by retargeting.** I use a combination of Facebook ad retargeting, Google ad retargeting, email marketing, and SMS marketing also little tweaks that make my store much more profitable and do so in a way that‚Äôs really automated. This increases the lifetime value of your customer (LTV) by a huge amount, and is necessary in order to make your top of funnel ads more profitable. Unlike trying to use cold Facebook ads at top of funnel and testing them out with heaps of ad sets/campaigns, retargeting generally is much more likely to be profitable ‚Äî and if even retargeting is not profitable, then there‚Äôs probably a very low chance that sending Facebook ads to even colder audiences is going to be profitable.
6. **Automate your product fulfilment**. Fundamentally you want to automate the delivery of your products so you spend *the least amount of time here possible*. Having to pack products for hours doesn‚Äôt make you a business, it makes you a self-employee ‚Äî maybe a worthwhile step at the start whilst you‚Äôre trying to learn the ins and outs of fulfilment, but you really want to be spending time growing your business instead of just working within it. Which leads to the next point‚Ä¶
7. **Automate your customer service too.** The key way to do this is to create systems for a freelancer to do it without your oversight. Again, answering customer enquiries for hours takes you away from the things that actually grow the business. You can do this at the start, but I would try to automate this as soon as you‚Äôve got a bit of cash.

# The traffic flow

If your Shopify store is a living creature, then traffic is the blood which keeps it alive and growing. Turning traffic into customers requires a little understanding of the stages that people *must* go through before they actually purchase from you. A stranger to your website is considered *top of funnel (TOFU)*. Someone who‚Äôs clicked the add to cart or checkout buttons can be considered *bottom of funnel (BOFU)*. The BOFU audience is always more profitable than the TOFU audience, but without any TOFU you don‚Äôt have BOFU at all.

**Unaware** ‚Äì no idea of problem or your product.

**Problem aware** ‚Äì knows they have a problem that they want solved, but don't know what is used to solve it.

**Solution aware** ‚Äì knows there is a solution, but don't know a specific product to solve it.

**Product aware** ‚Äì knows about your product.

**Most aware** ‚Äì someone who just needs a little push to buy your product. These audiences are really profitable.

## What this actually looks like

I use Google Ads as my TOFU. This high intent traffic has been really profitable for me. To achieve last year‚Äôs revenue of $69,000, I spent $20,300 on Google Ads to achieve that. This $20,300 also includes a significant amount of BOFU traffic mixed inside.

I use a combination of Google Ads, Facebook Ads, and Email as my BOFU.

* Google Ads: mixed in with the $20,300 above.
* Facebook Ads: I spent about $586 to get $2,338 of that revenue. It makes a really small portion of my advertising, but for me it‚Äôs equivalent to $3.98 for every $1 I spend on it.
* Email: I spent $360 on emails via Klaviyo. My email remarketing campaigns made me $3,158 of that revenue. This is equivalent to getting back $8.77 for every $1 I spend. I do much more here than people typically do.

There is an additional extreme benefit to email. **If you take away nothing from this article, you need to build an email list.** This is literally how you grow the value of your website over time. Every other piece of traffic is rented traffic; you can never make money from a fleeting customer from Facebook or Google again, unless you have a way to re-contact them. So by **collecting people‚Äôs emails, your website will actually grow more valuable over time,** and this protects against the random fluctuations that naturally occur with ads where sometimes you can just have a bad month.

There are, of course, other avenues that people love. SEO is a good one but takes a long time to see results, generally. There‚Äôs enough case studies on Instagram, and that‚Äôs probably been made easier with the recent addition of Instagram Shop inside the platform itself, but I haven‚Äôt tried it yet. And some others find TikTok useful too since growth is relatively quick, but again this is something I‚Äôm not too familiar with honestly.

## Automation

I hire from UpWork. I‚Äôll talk about this in more depth as hiring deserves its own article, but the fundamental principles that have helped me are:

* **Cheaper is not necessarily better.** It can be tempting to hire virtual assistants that are $8/hr from overseas, but this can often dilate in terms of time anyway and a job that would take 1 hours with a $24/hr assistant takes 3 hours with a $8/hr assistant. Gaming the system from a freelancer perspective is unfortunately quite common especially at these really low rates.
* **A rigorous vetting process helps sort out those who are serious to those who are not.** Depending on what you‚Äôre hiring for, the best way to try to differentiate those who can actually do something vs those who can‚Äôt, is to ask a technical question that can only be answered if they know the particular software and can‚Äôt really Google the answer. As a real basic example, you might give a question like ‚Äúin Excel, if I wanted to get the total value of all the costs added together from cells B2 to F2, what is the equation I would need to do that?‚Äù Doesn‚Äôt matter for this so much but matters more when you‚Äôre hiring for something more technical e.g. hiring for graphic design (‚Äúwhat‚Äôs the technical term when you apply two layers on top of another - for example, a vector circle in layer 2 and a .png image in layer one - and then make it so that only the image underneath the circle is shown?‚Äù) or coding (‚Äúif I wanted to use Python to automate a macro to click HTML elements, which package are you intending on using?‚Äù).
* **Sometimes you just need to try quickly, and fire quickly.** 90% of people you work with will be decent and honest. 10% will scam. One of the unfortunate things I came across was an Upwork freelancer who pretended to do work and clocked up hours, but then I realised that the files she was supposedly working on had nothing inside them!
* **Be a good boss.** No-one likes to work for bad people. Good employees will stick around for good people.

I don't care about the design and aesthetic of the count down timer at this point. I just need one that counts down normally lol. Sifted through 15 apps already and none are legit. Would love suggestions, thanks!Any legit timer countdown apps where you set the start &amp; end date/time and can assign different timers to different products?"

There's only Paypal as payment method for now because there isn't another payment method available for my country without opening a business (if it is profitable I'd open a business and use 2checkout.com).
I might close it soon because my dog needs a surgery and I won't be able to pay for facebook ads for it the next 2 months (more or less).
But if some of you think it has potential, maybe I'll leave it open until I get more money for ads.
To be honest, I'm hesitant about its potential, after $100 put on fb ads I got 1 sale, net loss of $76, I think is because mugs are hard to sell.

They find a product they like (Great!)

... but they don't end up buying the product.

Even with the best marketing it's hard to get those shoppers out the door with a sale. There are several reasons that they don't complete the buy. But there is one way to prevent it.

When you go to a store and you're at a checkout, what information do you provide? Just some cash or a card depending on how you're paying. They may ask you if you have or would like to join a rewards program for an extra discount, and you may take it or say no and continue about your day.

You may have noticed it by now but there's one thing that you may be doing backwards. 

Setting up an account for your shop.

A lot of shops still do this. Making their shoppers go through a whole account sign up process in order to buy what they really wanted, but by the time they see what they have to fill out, they lose interest.

Sounds like it shouldn't be a problem but any inconvenience can turn that potential shopper into a walker. So what's the alternative?

Here are two options: Guest Checkout and/or Open Authentication

**Guest Checkout** is pretty clear. As a shopper they have the ability to bypass creating an account and dive in straight to their information for their purchase.

**Open Authentication** is an easier way to get customers turned into members. Shoppers head to the checkout and are prompted with the ability to sign in using things that they are already logged into like Facebook, Gmail, or Twitter for example. This makes the registration process seamless and can even help with a faster checkout. 

There are plenty of Shopify apps that have the open authentication ability if that's what you're looking for. Overall, make it easier for your shoppers to complete their purchases and your sales will thank you!Get More Carts Out The Door"

346,shopify,"Hi everyone, we published a new guide on our website - [https://www.customervox.com/ecommerce-blog/7-critical-elements-to-make-effective-popups-for-seasonal-or-promotional-sales](https://www.customervox.com/ecommerce-blog/7-critical-elements-to-make-effective-popups-for-seasonal-or-promotional-sales)

As you know popups have a bad reputation, but they are effective and widely used in ecommerce. Would love to hear your feedback and your experience with popups. 

As you know popups have a bad reputation. They interrupt navigation and disrupt the customer journey. But the truth is that a well-designed popup can be the virtual equivalent of a blockbuster sale: Top performing popups enjoy a conversion rate of 3.1%, making them more effective than display ad marketing campaigns and many other forms of promotion. Popups also have the advantage that, beyond the initial cost, you can run them free of charge. 

The trick is that there is a right way and a wrong way to go about popups. This is especially true with regard to seasonal offers or other promotional sales. Done right, sales and discount popups inform visitors that you are running a sale and that they can buy products on your website for less. Mostly, sales popups are used as an entry or a timed popup, in order to facilitate a visitor‚Äôs interaction with the site.

To get more customers and increase sales and revenue, you have a lot of options: email promotion, search or display ads, posts on social networks, affiliate or referral partners‚Äîthe list goes on. However, when it comes to promoting a sale, popups are often your best bet. It‚Äôs no coincidence sales popups are among some of the most popular and effective popups.

**Sales campaigns**

Most ecommerce websites run different sales campaigns during the year, especially throughout the holidays. We have all encountered campaigns for Black Friday, Cyber Monday, Thanksgiving, and Christmas sales. When seasonal sales begin, most ecommerce sites offer significant discounts and run popup campaigns to advertise them.

A typical sales campaign may include discounts, free samples, or bonuses like free shipping targeted for a particular season. These campaigns are a great opportunity to offer products and deals that make sense in the context of a certain holiday.

For example, around Mother‚Äôs Day, many shoppers will want to buy women‚Äôs clothes, flowers, or cosmetics. Based on the demographics of your customers, see which products from your store would make the most relevant gifts for Mother‚Äôs Day. Then offer a sale on those products.

Case in point: West Elm uses this popup to promote their Mother‚Äôs Day sale, inviting visitors to buy their mother a present crafted by popular mom bloggers. 

Unique, relevant, and clear, this offer is likely to wow visitors and convince them to purchase a one-of-a-kind gift for their own moms. But it doesn‚Äôt just happen magically! In fact, this popup is carefully composed and calculated to convert customers.

**Effective popups**

To be effective, popups need to follow certain principles. Otherwise, customers will not absorb the information and actually make a purchase.

Here are seven critical elements that go into every effective popup:

\- Clarity

\- Control

\- Creativity

\- Relevance

\- Charm

\- Value

\- Respect

Combined, these qualities make the difference between a successful popup and an unsuccessful popup. At best, a popup will convert a visitor into a customer. At worst, a popup will cause a visitor to close their browser window and leave your store. With only a split second to win over the customer, there‚Äôs very little margin for error, so let‚Äôs explore each of these essential principles in detail.

**Clarity**

Clarity means that the information you are trying to convey to your visitor is clear and unambiguous. If your customer cannot understand the information, they will be unlikely to convert or click on your call to action.

Informing customers of a discount or sale may seem pretty straightforward. But keep in mind you have to convey not only what you offer, but also how the sale applies to them. 

It‚Äôs important to offer full information and not omit any details. For instance, if you leave out a crucial detail about how some shoppers are not eligible for your offer, you are going to undermine the trust of some customers.

Hyphen provides a good example of using very clear language to promote an offer. The copy explains to visitors that they will receive $100 off each product they buy, provides a code, and mentions when the deal ends.

In addition, there is an element of urgency in the form of a countdown timer. The call to action is also clear and prominent in the popup. 

**Control**

When a customer navigates to your website, they want to be in full control of the experience. In fact, the main advantage of a website is that visitors can peruse it at their leisure.

By using a popup, in a way, you take the control away from your visitor. You attempt to point them in the direction you want them to take. This is the danger of popups, and it‚Äôs the main reason why people are repelled by poorly-designed ones. 

In order to avoid this problem, you need to enable your visitors to opt-out of your popup easily. If visitors can‚Äôt reclaim control quickly and easily, they will not be able to continue their customer experience and will most likely close their browser window, leaving your website.

Furniture retailer Apt2B uses their popup not only for sales but also to generate leads. Their call to action button invites visitors to leave their email addresses in order to receive future promotional emails. The main point of the popup, however, is to inform visitors of the 4th of July sale.

The common ‚Äúx‚Äù button at the right-hand corner of the popup allows customers to maintain control over their experience. The copy, in the patriotic spirit of the holiday, offers furniture made in the USA.

**Creativity**

This principle is one of the hardest to nail down. To woo your visitors, you need to present them with compelling imagery and wording that will grab their attention. Customers who are delighted by a popup are much more likely to click on the call to action.

Include humorous copy or unexpected pieces of information to entice visitors to read the info all the way through rather than opt out.

United by Blue uses a popup for Black Friday. The copy is unusual, as it invites customers to help celebrate Blue Friday, providing an unexpected twist with the wording. True to the spirit of the brand, they use ‚ÄúGet Involved‚Äù as their call to action, since United by Blue promotes a sustainable and environmentally friendly lifestyle.

**Relevance**

Crucially, the popup must be relevant to the customer. It needs to convey appropriate information and should also connect with the page the customer is visiting. If the popup doesn‚Äôt align with the content, the visitor will likely close it and proceed to the information they intended to find.

Your popup also needs to align with your brand. The content of a popup should provide the same visual identity, brand voice, and language that your customers are familiar with and will expect from your business. A relevant deal that‚Äôs on brand makes the chances higher that customers will actually convert.

**Halloween popup**

This highly relevant popup uses a pumpkin with a clock to indicate that time is running out for customers to take the deal. The copy clearly provides an incentive to seize the one-of-a-kind offer.

**Charm**

The charm of a popup is closely connected to its creativity. If the copy is creative, the charm part will take care of itself. Sufficiently charmed visitors may even share links to your website in order to show your interesting popup to their friends.

The charm of a popup is hard to quantify, but the best indicator is its conversion rate.

This Christmas promotion from Applecrumby &amp; Fish uses an image of a baby in a Santa Claus suit to promote baby toys. Both relevant and cute, it‚Äôs likely to grab the attention of visitors and get leads, thanks to its high charm quotient.

**Value**

Like every other call to action or conversion process on your website, a popup needs to give something of value to your visitor in order for any of them to convert. For sales popups, the promise of value is very clear: an opportunity to purchase a product at a lower price than usual.

This popup offers value to customers by prolonging holiday giveaways. Visitors may already be familiar with Madewell‚Äôs holiday offers, but this popup informs them that holiday sales are still on.

**Respect**

Finally, an effective popup should pay your customers proper respect. Many websites make the mistake of using what is referred to as ‚Äúoffensive‚Äù copy in their opt-out buttons. Popups should not attempt to shame customers into accepting offers or opting in with phrases such as ‚ÄúI do not like to save money‚Äù or similar guilt-inducing sentences.

**Conclusion**

Contrary to popular belief, sales popups can actually be very interesting and useful as a tool to increase conversions. Their main advantage is they are instantaneous and provide information to your visitors without delay. However, they interrupt a visitor‚Äôs journey and need to be managed with care.

This is why popups should be as entertaining as possible. You can capture interest by presenting valuable and relevant information in a charming offer. Above all, ensure that the respectful content will allow visitors to maintain control of the interaction.

Conversion rates reach into over 50% for the best performing popups, making them a prime example of efficient marketing tactics for ecommerce stores. Now, it is up to you.

355,shopify,"With the coming end of Stitch Labs, we're anxiously looking for a good replacement. If this applies to you, realize you have roughly a month to pick your replacement if you don't want to interrupt service while getting the new system up and running. I personally put a ton of time into moving my company to SkuVault; Ultimately, it didn't work for us, but they were great and the price was good so I want to share it with others, so my work isn't just a waste. Here's what I like:

* Waaay less expensive than other options we're looking at.
* Support for serialized inventory.
* Pulls Shopify orders on UPDATE every 15 minutes - This is a big deal for me, as Shopify sucks at exchanges, so we're always editing orders and then having to manually update Stitch after. Many others only pull Shopify orders on creation, which is sub-optimal.
* Doesn't try to be everything to everyone, but it does inventory really well.

Why it didn't work for me: we have a specific need to be able to manually hold/release orders pushed to other software, and it just couldn't work the way we needed it to with SKUVault. Otherwise, it would have been perfect for us.

I just received a request for my first wholesale order. The order would be for about ~$4000  (after a large wholesale discount).

Our AOV is around $45, so this is quite large!

I'm concerned this may be some type of chargeback scam. What's the best way for me to accept this order safely?

I received the request via email. It came from a domain-email looking to be a store that stocks products like ours. On the surface it looks like it makes sense but the website does not look very reputable. Many of the links like ""About Us"" ""Contact Us"" do not function.

I responded to the email with our wholesale pricing. They responded quickly asking for an invoice including shipping so that they can provide their credit card information for payment.

I've never accepted such a large order before and I want to make sure to do this safely if it is indeed legit. What steps should I take here to ensure that I am not scammed?

I'm thinking to use some form of non-reversible payment like a wire transfer. Would that be the standard practice here?

1. Find your ideal customers. Recency, frequency, and monetary (RFM)  segmentation analysis can help you identify your most valued customers.
1. Identify your top and toxic products. Removing toxic products and optimizing your inventory will reduce low-value customers and encourage high-value customers.
1. Focus on the customer journey. Buy from yourself to experience interacting with your brand and using your products. Map the journey, and  deliver value at every touchpoint of that journey.
1. Shift your focus from new customer acquisitions to ideal customer acquisitions. Target those who RFM segmentation identify as your best customers, not the average consumer.

I'm currently having some trouble getting my products listed on Google through the Google Merchant Center. Google says my account is suspended due to:

* Misrepresentation of self or product (Untrustworthy promotions) 

Looking in my GMC account it says my product data for all products is disapproved or invalid for Shopping Ads but Active for free listings for all but one listing (which bizarrely is disallowed for ""Forbidden pharmaceuticals or products making misleading claims""). The issue is:

&gt; Violation of Shopping ads policy 

I can see that my issue will fall into one of the four categories that covers shopping ads policies:

* Prohibited content;
* Prohibited practices;
* Restricted content; or
* Editorial &amp; technical requirements.

When I got a reply from Google at my attempt to request a re-review I was told the following:

&gt;Google‚Äôs primary objective is to provide safe, relevant experiences for  our users. The decision to suspend your account was made after careful  review of your account and the low quality landing page experiences  promoted through your website. We won't be able to provide you with any  further details regarding the suspension of the account. 

Based on this, and considering I do not sell prohibited or restricted content and I do not engage in prohibited practices, my issue is falling under Editiorial &amp; technical requirements.

I'm not sure it would be the product descriptions; these are as close to the suppliers descriptions as possible because I wanted to avoid any misrepresentation. I add some of my own comments, for example with the hot chocolate I recommend what milk I use. I take my own pictures as well because I want to make that aspect my own.

I have the required legal pages all listed in my footer.

On futher investigation I can only think that my issue might be the speed of my website on mobile. I ran every page I have through Lighthouse. My pages on desktop range from 88 - 100 with only two pages below 90. My pages on mobile are worse, ranging from 36 - 94. My lowest scoring pages are the product pages because of the product images, I believe, although Lighthouse says most of the problem stems from Google CDN.

My products are still being disapproved after I have been through and tidied up the pages as much as I can, implemented lazy loading, updated product images, and optimised the image sizes and I'm a bit lost for how to fix it.

Does anyone have any experience with this that might help me get the issue resolved?

418,shopify,"Every time we want to buy a product, we waste hours researching a product and reading reviews.

The biggest frustrations with online product research are:

1. Fake reviews
2. Sponsored content/ Ads
3. It takes time

Wouldn't it be great to have a service that solves all this for me?

That's why we are building [reviewr.ai](https://reviewr.ai/). It's like having a team of people reviewing products for you and summarizing the important points at a speed that would take hours to research on your own.

**How does it work?**

1. Fetching product reviews from your Shopify store.
2. Scraping reviews about your product from trusted sources on the web.
3. Running it through our fake detection
4. Doing a sentiment analysis
5. Our AI generates a brief and concise summary of all the reviews

**Example**

This is how such a summary looks like for [some leather boots](https://www.buyforlife.com/products/8/red-wing-shoes-iron-ranger):

* *The leather is thick and durable.*
* *Red Wing has an excellent track record for quality and durability.*
* *They last for years, and they can be resoled.*
* *Red Wings are well made with longevity in mind. With proper care, will last a long time.*
* *The boots have a timeless design that is versatile to wear with different outfits.*
* *The break-in period was about a month, but once broken in, the boots are very comfortable.*
* *Expensive but worth it.*

**What's next?**

We will soon launch our Shopify App. If you're interested in a free trial and giving us early feedback, signup for the beta [here](https://www.reviewr.ai/beta-signup).

428,shopify,"Hello all, another questions for y'all!

Background on my shopify business (launching this month once I figure out all the finer details, I have my inventory and product photography done.)- I will be selling handcraft wedding decor and favors from Pakistan. These are items used commonly in Indian/Pakistani weddings. The items are not particularly large or heavy but it does include sets of some items. For example, I have favor pouches. There are 3 different types, each type sells in a set of 4, with all 4 being different colors. (So one peach/pink/seagreen/gray theme set of pouches, one red/green/yellow/orange set of pouches, etc.) These will likely be sold in large quantities as its typically one pouch per guest. I also have other items that involve multiple parts (ex. a mirror tray with 3 types of cups used for a ceremony). In total, I have about 30 SKUs. 

I am currently paying $60 per month for a 5x10 storage unit. I have no free palce to put it. Can't use my garage as Texas heat will damage some of my products. And I am currently planning to ship everything myself, fulfillment centers for shopify is something I wasn't aware of before. 

I am just trying to get more info. I have reached out to a few centers myself for details but its hard to gauge any type of pricing, especially because all my products are so different and it's not like I sell just one type of thing, which is what im finding most info to be about. Do y'all think this is something to look into further at this time? Anyone know the cost? Or even just the type of cost- monthly, per order charge, etc?

So my question is, if I were to hire someone on fiverr or elsewhere to make my website, what benefit is there to that as opposed to buying out the pro theme and building it out myself?

433,shopify,"Hi all! I am kickstarting a venture that sells cultural wedding decor and favors. The majority of my products I have an inventory of here in the US and those will be shipped domestically easily, I understand how to handle all that. I have 2 specific favor box things that my vendor in Pakistan will custom make for every single order. These items come in 15 different color options and my vendor makes custom tags attached to them. With most weddings in our culture being easily 100+ guests and favors are one per person, you can see why it'd be hard for me to keep an inventory of this product. I'd need like 1000 of each color minimum (I expect this item to be quite popular, its very unique and I am pricing very reasonably).

My vendor has experience shipping this exact product to the US and other countries. Production is about 7-10 days and DHL takes 4-5 days to ship, so thats 2 weeks to prep and ship the product. I plan to keep the expected shipping time as 3 weeks on my shopify to be safe. I am confused how I will go about setting shipping for this product. I will have a flat rate price based on quantities (25/50 will be $40, 100 will be $60, 200+ will be $80). Any guidance or video suggestions would be fantastic as I can't find anything that shows me how to handle two ship out addresses. I hope that all made sense!

&gt;Hi Ankit,  
&gt;  
&gt;We're reaching out because your account and/or accounts you are the listed user on has received a high volume of disputes from your customers. Stripe is unable to support businesses with a dispute rate consistently above 1%. In order to help you remediate this issue and learn more about how disputes work, we've put together this resource: [https://stripe.com/docs/disputes](https://stripe.com/docs/disputes).  
In order to continue to support your business, you'll need to take action to reduce your dispute rates. To learn more about dispute prevention, see here: [https://stripe.com/docs/disputes/prevention](https://stripe.com/docs/disputes/prevention). If we don't see a decline in your dispute rates, we will have to take action on your account which may include holding funds in reserve or termination.  
To help you track and monitor your dispute activity, the Reports Overview section of your dashboard includes information about your disputes: [https://dashboard.stripe.com/dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/dashboard)  
If you have any questions, please reply directly to this email for assistance.  
Best,  
Stripe

It's¬†not¬†true,¬†I¬†have¬†had¬†zero¬†disputes¬†so¬†far.

**Here was Stripe's response**

&gt;Hi Ankit,  
&gt;  
&gt;Thank you for reaching out Stripe Support.  
&gt;  
&gt;It's lovely to meet you! I hope your day is treating you well so far. Based on the thread, you have concerns with the email that we sent about high dispute risk. Thanks for your patience while we got back to you on this!  
&gt;  
&gt;I apologize for this, but don't worry, I'm checking this with my team for another look at your Stripe account. We'll be sure to get back in touch once we're done, or if we need additional information.  
&gt;  
&gt;In the meantime, please feel free to write in on thread if you have other concerns. I'm just an email away.  
&gt;  
&gt;Best regards,

**Their reply, after a few days.**

&gt;Hi Ankit,  
We're writing to let you know that, after conducting a review of your business, we've found that it presents a higher level of risk than we are able to work with at this time.  
Transitioning off Stripe:  
We understand that moving away from Stripe can take time, so your service is not ending immediately. To help with the transition to a new payment processor, we're able to provide you 5 additional days (beginning today) to switch to a new provider. After this time, you won't be able to accept charges on your account.  
Because of the elevated risk associated with your account, your balance will be placed on reserve for the next 90 days (the industry-standard period during which most payments are disputed). During this time, the reserved funds will help cover any disputes or unforseen refunds on your account. The remaining balance (%E2%80%99[https://dashboard.stripe.com/balance/overview%E2%80%99](https://dashboard.stripe.com/balance/overview%E2%80%99)) will be paid out to your bank account at the end of this period.  
Why is this necessary?  
Stripe is obligated to cover any losses incurred by merchants in the event that they cease operations. As a result, we are required by law to complete several types of review for every business that signs up with us.  
We're also subject to strict requirements imposed by our partners in the payments ecosystem that dictate the level of risk that we're allowed to support. We use multiple sources of information as part of our reviews in order to determine whether or not businesses on Stripe conform to these policies and restrictions.  
We want to make very clear that we're not casting any doubts over the viability of your business. That said, your business is operating in an industry which is considered high risk by our financial partners, and for that reason, we have no option but to discontinue our service to you.  
If you need an alternative payment processor, we recommend considering [PaymentCloud](https://paymentcloudinc.com/stripe.), which works with businesses with a higher level of risk than we're able to support.  
We're sorry that we can't offer you ongoing service, and wish you the best of luck with your business.

Well, holy moly. If you're looking for Teespring millionaires that have gone on to create a brand juggernaut in the POD space, you've found them. I didn't check my emails as early as I normally would have this morning however when I did I was as excited as a teenage girl nailing her first TikTok dance.

Keegan and Corey are the industry kingpins, the Titans of t-shirts, the professors of print on demand, the kings of our industry.

I owe a lot of my own success to these guys as Keegan was our original coach back in the day when we were learning how to sell on Teespring. With that same knowledge and the inspiration these guys provide, we continue to do [crazy numbers as well ($732,701.35 in 3 weeks)](https://www.storehacks.com/storehacks-3-weeks-732701-35-with-print-on-demand-jewelry-the-rapid-scaling-system-you-can-use-to-blow-up-your-pod/).

I love these guys and got to spend a few days with them in their old office, hanging out, drinking, tours, and just getting to know the men behind one of the biggest successes of print on demand ecommerce.

This is their story so far, it's certainly nowhere near what they will achieve with the drive and determination these guys have.

They have done some crazy things from working with the guys from barstool sports to the heavyweight champion of the world Mike Tython.

## App Stack

**Klaviyo** \- If you aren't emailing daily, you are leaving tons of money on the table. If you are cloning/duplicating without changing out images, products, or content, you are emailing half-assed.

If you provide genuine content and great emails, your emails can generate thousands of dollars in sales a day. We really love the functionality and ease of using Klaviyo vs other services.

**LOOX Reviews** \- This review app is awesome! It really incentivizes your customers to send in reviews along with pictures.

The best part is it's 90% automated. We have a team member who approves reviews and passes along great fan photos to the marketing team for email and social purposes.

**Bulk Product Edit** \- Time management is key in this business. If you waste a ton of time doing manual things when you could automate a task, you're losing money. Spend time doing revenue generating tasks.

Bulk Product Edit allows you to quickly change SKU's, product descriptions, etc. Set it, and forget it.

**Attentive:** SMS Marketing is the latest trend in reaching your customers where they spend time at. Do you spend more time texting friends &amp; family or checking emails? That should answer any question you have in regard to SMS marketing.

We have used Attentive for close to 2 years now. To me, there is nobody that comes close to the amount of customer service, training, help, etc. that you get from Attentive, when it comes to App partners.

## Q. Where are you based? Do you have a family? What do you do for work and fun?

We are based out of Clayton, North Carolina

### Keegan Rush

I live in Garner, NC. I have lived in North Carolina my entire life and would never want to change that. Whenever we travel to cities like New York, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, etc.

I always return with a sense of gratitude for how much I love where I am from and where my family is. Our roots are firmly planted in North Carolina and I wouldn't want to leave for any reason.

I do have a family and wouldn't change them for the world. My amazing wife Sara and 1-year old son Boston are the reason I attack every day with the mentality to level up to give them a better life.

For work, I sell stuff online, whilst building brands with the ultimate goal of selling as much stuff as physically possible. **My goal is to always improve the lives of those I surround myself with**. I want to provide a better life for my family, partners, clients, employees, suppliers, etc., and their families.

That can be done by selling more stuff and growing the business. For fun, I love to spend time with family and friends, drive my Audi R8 fast, and sell stuff. Most would call that ""work"", but I genuinely love to sell stuff, so it doesn't feel like work to me.

I'm also a big Chicago sports fan, as well as a Duke Blue Devil fan. Sports has always been a staple in our lives, which has instilled an intense level of competition.

That level of competition has helped us aggressively scale the business but, also to take office Ping-Pong way too seriously. You take the good, with the bad right?

### Corey Rush

Angier, NC is where I call home. I've got an awesome and very supporting wife Elizabeth, and 3 of the coolest kids ever in Carson, Piper, and Palmer.

If we aren't at the ball field with Carson, we enjoy hanging outdoors with the grill on; and the wine pouring! WORK for me personally is fun, when we made the decision to build this e-commerce thing into a true business; it was a decision to do what we loved and what we were pretty darn good at.

Outside of my Family and the Blue Pack Squad; I enjoy really good Wine (Caymus, Far Niente, and Plumpjack are my favorites). We set a goal to buy supercars, so I purchased an original McLaren 12C and it's been LOADS of FUN.

**It drives very much like how we run Blue Pack Marketing, FAST and STRONG!**

## Q. What did you do before becoming a ecommerce millionaire?

### Keegan Rush

Before discovering Teespring and becoming an internet marketer, I worked in retail at a Sports Memorabilia store and ran a couple of websites on the side.

üì∑

**I learned Photoshop, basic coding, and in general became very computer literate**, which led to being able to design my first round of initial designs that took off. That was the inspiration I needed to eventually become a Teespring millionaire, and inevitably an ecommerce millionaire.

The combination of retail, plus computer literacy, definitely gave me a leg up on the competition before becoming one of the first teespring millionaires.

After running successfully by myself for 6 months, I decided to ask my big brother for help with the ""business"" aspect, and he initially helped with the books and taxes. After seeing the massive potential, he came on as a partner, and we formalized everything, he left his corporate job, and we attacked this full time with 2 minds, instead of 1.

We launched [Blu Pack Marketing](https://bluepackmarketing.com/) and It's been scaling higher and higher by the day. Now we have an awesome team at Blue Pack, with like-minded individuals who attack every day, as hungry as the day before.

### Corey Rush

Prior to starting Blue Pack Marketing with my brother, I was working my way up the corporate ladder with the Couche-Tarde (Circle K Convenience/Gas) organization. I operated as a Director at the age of 28 and controlled up to 3 states over 150 stores/2,000 employees during my tenure.

The corporate world while rewarding and exciting simply wasn't one for me. My brother Keegan and I had started 3-4 smaller ventures prior to creating Blue Pack Marketing; 2 of which were very successful so we knew we worked well together.

So when we decided we were going to double down on this ""online selling"" thing; I did what any normal guy would do......I went home and told my pregnant wife, in our brand new home that I was quitting my job to sell stuff online with my brother. Little did she know at the time that we'd soon be Teespring millionaires.

She supported me the whole way, and we have never looked back.

## Q. How often do you launch new products?

Before becoming Teespring millionaires we would launch as many campaigns as possible.

Now, we launch 1-2 new products a week. We have a vast array of outlets to test these products whether it's Facebook Lives, a Facebook Group, Email List, SMS List, Social Posts to track engagement, etc.

If you go to bat twice and strike out twice, you're 0/2 and forgettable. If you go to bat 10 times a month and get on base 4 times, you're batting .400 and in the hall of fame with that average.

&amp;#x200B;

## Q. Where do most of your customers come from? Google search? Social Media? Other sites?

Facebook is our main vehicle for sales if you look at %'s however email, Instagram, and Google Shopping are contributing larger chunks to the sales engine by the day. Instead of trying to be superstars in everything, we've built up team members and partners to be the Michael Jordan of their own specific area.

Corey and I put the lion's share of our ad focus into Facebook while we have somebody specifically handling the other sales channels. A lot of focus, testing, and reading is required to stay up to date on all of the recent Facebook algo changes.

I think we have always been great at maneuvering the waters during change, to not only stay profitable but also to see the growth even when things are down for most others. Part of that speaks to the power of the brand in our stores.

People visit brands, they don't visit pop-up T-Shirt shops that look fly by night-ish. If you were to turn off all ads, between email and organic traffic, we have a couple of brands that would still do 7 figures a year easily.

## Q. I‚Äôd love to hear more about your ecommerce successes to date. What great things have come to you through building your success and growing your store? Would love to hear a story.

There are a couple of stories that immediately stand out when I think of our successes, being among the first teespring millionaires was definitely one of those moments.

**1.)** **We have generated over $250,000,000+ in sales**, possibly more if we had more accurate tracking on some brick &amp; mortar, television, and local work we've completed over time. This is from brands that we own and/or platform sales over the years.

It also includes wholesale channels into brick &amp; mortar boutiques and stores. We have had 1 brand in over 200+ locations that we eventually sold. Our current brand is in over 700 retail locations and trending to be in over 1,500 by the end of the year.

We've built this wholesale pipeline from the ground up and are now executing at a really high level. We have taken a Shopify brand and cultivated a wholesale distribution channel, which to my knowledge hasn't been done on this scale.

**2.)** We have successfully exited 2 Shopify/E-Com companies in the 6-figure range. We are hoping our next major acquisition is in the 8 figure range and current valuations dictate that.

**3.)** We made it a goal to both be driving supercars. One day Corey mentioned that we should go do it and within 72 hours, Corey had a McLaren and I (Keegan) had an Audi R8. Now we want to outfit all of our team members in supercars.

It will make driving past our office each day a true spectacle.

**4.)** We've always worked in the e-com space, we have had multiple relationships that approach us about advertising in other arenas. We accept clients based on relationships, compared to seeking them out ourselves.

### Success with Serious Brand Power

We took on some work for the History Channel. We were able to rank a TV show in the Top 50 most-watched programs in the United States that night. It went up against a competitor's similar show, who did the national talk show circuit with Ellen, Fallon, Conan, etc.

We ranked in the Top 50, they were ranked 83. It was a very small advertising budget but, we were able to crush it and make waves on a national stage. It was a success because we had no idea what to expect from the results being that we're sellers in the ecom space.

We've amplified the client side of our business and most notably handled the stores for Mike Tyson, The Hodge Twins, and Donald Trump Jr.

It showed that a lot of our principles can be applied across multiple industries.

## Q: What platform/tools do you use for your business?

Full QuickBooks integration with an accounting department to ensure all invoices are checked for accuracy.

Sometimes an invoice might accidentally have 3-4 extra items in it, with multiple suppliers, multiple brands, that can easily add up over the course of a year, you need to be very careful.

We now have in-house developers vs utilizing an agency for conversion rate optimization. This allows for more dedicated focus, nimble movement, and a function of deeper caring.

Having a team member who looks at that like it is their own baby has been a very pivotal change for us. In a massive business, moving the needle 1% is huge. We try to do that multiple times throughout the year to find savings, that we can redeploy as investment capital.

## Q. What‚Äôs your number 1 tip for new dropshippers getting into the industry?

Structure your business from the start, don't let the money fool you! Early on, before becoming Teespring millionaires, we learned to follow a structured system.

Statistics simply aren't on your side as an entrepreneur with over 90% of ventures never operating in the black. **(Profitable).**

Throughout the last 5 years and companies that we have started and sold (That's right we have built up Shopify Brands and SOLD THEM); if your supply chain/organizational structure/customer service isn't all on the same page.....YOU WILL FAIL.

Unfortunately, this isn't something that is managed by an application, or something that a virtual assistant can do off the bat; it's something that will require you to lay out a very detailed game plan.

The other part about the structure that many e-commerce teams struggle with is tracking financials and actually analyzing them. Are you winning on shipping? Product weights correct? Accounting for larger sizes?

Are you accounting correctly for expenses? These are all questions that if you don't STRUCTURE from the start, there is a higher chance that your business will end up failing.

Don't take in money, pay invoices and ad spend, and assume the rest is profit. Make sure you're tracking your expenses and profit daily.

We do this 7 days a week and account for every dollar divided by 30 days a month for accurate tracking/accounting.

447,shopify,"Hello,

I've seen a couple similar posts where people have just been laughed at or told they will get no where but, I'm hoping I can have some luck by being more specific.

1) I want to open a Shopify drop shipping store, I have a small budget and some ideas but really am having a hard time honing in and making some decisions. I have some design experience but not enough to build a converting store. I have some pretty specific goals, not just ""i wanna be a millionaire by next week""

What I can bring to the table is a consistent budget, nothing major - but consistent. What I'm looking for is someone to help me make some decisions, design the shop and run the marketing, and teach me how to support the upkeep. I know returns wont come right away and may take a few months. Let's split the profit once I recoup my investments for as long as you're helping me.

I'd love to see what you've built.

Or...

2) Maybe you have an existing store that's doing some pretty good traction and for whatever reason, the idea of an investor is exciting to you. Again, I don't have much, but I can consistently invest in return for a share of your profits.

Hopefully I get something out of this! I'm essentially just trying to put myself through school and am trying to not work my 9-5 fulltime for a couple years.

Looking forward to some replies :)

I haven't come across any posts relating to my question. So on my Shopify website, I'm selling a box with the following: one pencil, one eraser, and one notebook. That's the only box I'm selling.

So I went viral on one of my facebook posts and had a insane number of orders this week around $20k in orders, Right away my payouts were put on hold and I was required to submit an id and other general information, which I did. My payouts were then enabled. Now today they were again disabled, so I contacted support and the support team forwarded me to the risk management team. and i am now awaiting a email from them, they only operate monday-friday so I probably wont hear back till monday.

I went over the Shopify Tos and im selling NOTHING illegal nor am I lieing about the products im selling. I have had 0 chargebacks. I have had to refund 10-20 people because a item i was selling went out of the stock, so could that be a reason why this happened?

I have a couple questions,

Should I fulfill all the orders I got? - Im worried since if I fulfill them what if Shopify makes me refund everyone? And If I don't fulfill them they can arrive late and that can lead to chargebacks.

Should I stop payments on my site? - Im getting more orders every hour

Should I start migrating to another eCommerce site? - I want to make sure im up and running in the worst case scenario my site is closed

Should I maybe accept another payment provider? - Theres a lot of other payment providers on their site I can connect im just not sure which one I should choose if I should accept another one.

Sorry for all the questions and would love some help on this.

We want to move into International shipping but we understand that there are quite a few requirements and rules for shipping into an international customers country. To give you insight on where we are at, here are a few details on our progress into International Shipping:

* Zonos Duties &amp; Taxes App Integration (Shopify App)
* FedEx Carrier Account Setup (Shipping Carrier connection)

Both of these resources are what we are currently working with in order to take that step into International shipping. 

Since we can't just simplify international shipping to just that singular allocation, we would like to describe what countries/regions that are on our radar for opening up. We'd like to start shipping internationally in:

* United Kingdom
* Germany
* Sweden
* Netherlands
* Poland
* Denmark, etc.

We have searched dozens of forums and looked through many posts but to no avail, we can't find anything that can help us with creating and registering for UK/EU VAT and HMRC setup. Majority of our international site-visitors are from the UK and the EU region, and this is where we get asked the most about when we will go international.

She would like to open to purchase once day a week. So the D-day we will be able to purchase, but the other days of the week, we still need to be show the products.

My question is : is it possible to have a full control of collection page ? I mean to get all product via a specific request ? 

I already develop something similar on wordpress/woocommerce, but my client would like to be on shopify because she used to use it.

Do not propose me to publish the product with quantity at 0 ... she actually does that for now, it is her pain point, because every d-day, she needs to change the quantity at the opening day \^\^

I also found this cheat sheet [https://www.shopify.com/partners/shopify-cheat-sheet](https://www.shopify.com/partners/shopify-cheat-sheet)   
but apparently, there is nothing to query ... for example, collections.products only returns 50 published products. What if we would like 75, or 100 ?   


I have the feeling that it could be achieve by creating a next or nuxt.js front-end app, with rest api or graphql. But not directly with a template theme shopify.

Thanks for your feedback ![developer] custom query for products we want on collection page"

Basically, I explained that I currently have a wix e-commerce website that I am set to launch in a couple months. I honestly like the interface of wix and the look of the website I created. However, I‚Äôve heard a lot of bad things about wix. 

There‚Äôs mixed sentiment in my post from yesterday but the majority of the comments say that for larger scale businesses Shopify is the way to go and that if I think my business will grow, it‚Äôs worth switching now rather than later.

Yesterday, I started a Shopify account and played around with their interface and honestly so far I‚Äôm not too fond of it. It doesn‚Äôt seem nearly as customizable and there seems to be fewer features. In order to get the look I want, it seems like I have to purchase a new theme. And then if I decide I don‚Äôt like it, then I‚Äôm out that cost?Obviously I‚Äôm new to this and could be wrong and that‚Äôs why I came here to post this. 


Basically, Ive had no problems with wix but everyone loves Shopify and there has to be reasons I‚Äôm not seeing. I know wix received a lot of hate years ago but it seems like they‚Äôve improved dramatically in e-commerce and digital marketing. 

I appreciate anyone‚Äôs advice or perspective you can offer. Thank you.What makes Shopify better than Wix?"

However, an inadequately trained returns associate then refunded those returned orders, thinking they were RMAs, meaning the customer ultimately both received their order AND got their money back.

None of the customers said anything about this even though we did them a huge favor...

Update #1:

I emailed them and told them honestly that we would cancel all orders going forward due to the level of risk with an order of this size. I also told them if they wired the funds we could process the order.

At the suggestion of ruedumonde, we‚Äôre moving forward with a better app/company to help protect us called clear.sale.

Hi everyone,

I noticed many of you posted about issues you're facing with approving and activating your Google Merchant Center.

I've created a short article explaining the common issues that cause the suspension of the Google MC, and the ways to fix them.

[https://www.adscale.com/2021/03/03/how-to-fix-for-google-merchant-center-misrepresentation-issues/](https://www.adscale.com/2021/03/03/how-to-fix-for-google-merchant-center-misrepresentation-issues/)How to Fix for Google Merchant Center Misrepresentation Issues"

560,shopify,"Ilana Davis, the leading expert in accessibility and ADA compliance joined me for three episodes of [Pitstop](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/lucas-walkers-pitstop/id1539922392).

##**Episode 1 - Upgrading your Homepage without a Redesign**

[Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0HIgJyDxA0qVu1aOfjxNWQ?si=RWSVw3huQISSZogdLg1KSw) / [Apple](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/rescue-your-shopify-page-by-streamlining-presentation/id1539922392?i=1000510713219). 8:56

###**Key Takeaways**

* Less is more; don't overwhelm the consumer with countless product options, special deals, or flashy image carousels
* Concentrate what is shown by presenting only your primary products upfront on your homepage
* Know what your customers come to you for, and focus on that specific product or service
* Don't over-complicate or add steps to purchasing a product; if there's an image of what you are selling on your page, clicking on it should bring the customer to a page where they can buy it
* Avoid turning you page into a maze, if customers can't quickly find their way back to the product they want, they'll leave

##**Episode 2 -  Maximize Website Conversions By Making Product Tabs Taboo**

[Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/episode/13N7zMUVmi5jtFY4gXDxTM?si=5POf4n58SZOBE2YogDTQ8g) / [Apple](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/maximize-website-conversions-by-making-product-tabs-taboo/id1539922392?i=1000510852418) 9:17

###**Key Takeaways**

* Hiding these details behind a variety of tabs confuse and irritate visitors, rather than effectively presenting the information they want.
* The same information can be displayed further down or in images
* Product tabs can effect SEO, and tabs can hide it from GooglePresenting this information clearly and upfront will increase not only website conversions, but also external traffic.

##**Episode 3 - Easy Ways you Can Make Your Site More Accessible**
[Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4Zekty0M4gXyKnu0nnn32C?si=BrJW5P9qT2W7MmNaEiBIyw) / [Apple](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/embrace-accessibility-to-increase-product-visibility/id1539922392?i=1000510949674) 11:36

###**Key Takeaways**

* Don't dismiss accessibility just because your product isn't primarily for disabled customers; 20% of consumers have a disability in one form or another
* Optimize your pages for screen reader apps and programs
* Add alt-text descriptions to any images included, especially product images
* Use clearly contrasting texts and backgrounds, rather than over-designed fonts or funky tones
* Accessibility advantages don't just allow and drive engagement and sales from those who suffer from restrictions or disabilities, they make shopping an easier and more enjoyable experience for all customers.

561,shopify,"Okay. So I'm in the process of buying a house (super excited, super nervous) and I know I can't make any large purchases and avoid opening new credit cards or taking out loans. Is Shopify Capital a loan in the same sense that it may get flagged by the mortgage underwriter? I don't wanna screw up my mortgage, but I also know shopify capital preapproval only appears for \~30 days if you dont accept so mine will expire before I close on the house. Otherwise, I would just wait till after closing to even consider it. My business is a Sole Proprietorship so if it ends up as a loan on my credit its technically personal (even though its for the business). So my question is, is this all in house with shopify and not reported anywhere else, or do I need to just ignore it and hope they approve me again later?

577,shopify,"One of the key complaints about shopify is that the internal pages don't have a nice drag and drop builder like the home page. It has been on the road map for quite some time but we are still waiting on the feature. You could install a page builder app to help you achieve this but from a design perspective you can end up with different fonts, sizes and colors if you are not careful and making a simple change can become quite difficult to remain consistent across the site. There is also the issue of page speed to consider. 

You can have homepage sections on internal pages and allow for completely different sections on each page. It does take developer skills and a knowledge of shopify's schema to create this but it can be done. Below is the base Debut theme that comes with shopify that we are all familiar with. If you click around the base site you will see the usual pages with some basic content on there. 

**Base theme** \- [https://debut-theme-sections-all-pages.myshopify.com?preview\_theme\_id=120133222449](https://debut-theme-sections-all-pages.myshopify.com?preview_theme_id=120133222449)

This next link brings you to the same site but loads a more advanced debut theme that I modified to allow sections on all pages. You can navigate to the same pages as before but you will see that the layout is very different and there are now home page sections on every page. 

**Theme with sections on all pages** \- [https://debut-theme-sections-all-pages.myshopify.com?preview\_theme\_id=42965893169](https://debut-theme-sections-all-pages.myshopify.com?preview_theme_id=42965893169)

&amp;#x200B;

If you had access to the theme you would see that the customize theme section for each page has a new ""Customize Page"" sidebar menu where you can add content. These sections can be customized and moved around quite easily, just like on the homepage. I have included some quick screenshots for this.

607,shopify,"Hey [r/shopify](https://www.reddit.com/r/shopify/),

Dan here from EZ Order Tracking, a Shopify App that creates a mobile-friendly Order Tracking page on your store.

It's been 5 months since we started building the app and TODAY it is finally available to download on the official [Shopify App Store](https://apps.shopify.com/ezot?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=shopify&amp;utm_campaign=promo-launch).

We decided to build EZ Order Tracking because the current order tracking apps are old and outdated, but most importantly because they **cost a lot**.

You don't have to sell a kidney anymore just to get your very own tracking page, but don't confuse a low price point with less functionality.

# A few things about what EZ Order Tracking can do for you

1. Get a mobile-optimized order tracking page in less than 60 seconds. **Just install the app, click enable and you are all set.**
2. Easily edit anything on the page. Is your store in French, German, Spanish, or maybe Japanese? **It doesn't matter.** You can edit every little piece of text on your tracking page so it will match with your store's language. But that's not all, you can change the colors as well. Everyone knows that branding is important, so we made it extremely easy to change the color scheme as well.
3. Automatically send emails to your customers when their order status is changing. You can either set the emails inside the app or just connect EZ Order Tracking with Klaviyo.
4. Cross-sell at just the right time. The order tracking page is not just a place for your customers to see where their shipment is at. With the cross-selling functionality, you can show your customers any product of your choice, which will help you get sale after sale.
5. Track orders shipped by 100+ carriers. If you work with a courier company that has more than 2 vans and 4 employees, EZ Order Tracking will work for you.

# We want to help small businesses grow

We ran a pre-launch exclusive right here a few months ago, so if you are one of the early adopters check your email for directions on how to redeem your special plan.

Of course, we wouldn't post in this community without another special promo: install EZOT in the next 30 days and secure the **free forever plan featuring:**

* all current features;
* all upcoming updates;
* track up to 30 orders per month;
* send up to 90 emails per month;

We will keep up the free forever plan until the 25th of March 2021 because of the high costs associated with order tracking. But if you secure yours now you can keep it forever and ever.

All you have to do is go to the [official EZOT listing page on the Shopify App Store](https://apps.shopify.com/ezot?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=shopify&amp;utm_campaign=promo-launch) and install the app. That's it!

# The pricing plans for higher orders

**The Start plan - $4.97/month** \- allows you to track up to 80 orders per month and send up to 150 emails per month.

622,shopify,"Hey Guys,

So I am a semi-professional dropshipper- scaled about 3 products so far.... idk if thats even semi professional but had a quick question.

Just tested a new product this week and it seems to be a winner. 2 CBOs exact duplicate of each other have 3+ ROAS, another 1 CBO has 2.55 ROAS and 1 Adset level budget campaign has 4.60 ROAS. Have about 30 purchases and overall Return of 3.00.

Now, this is usually the easiest and funnest part for me, based on past experiences. All I do at this point when returns are awesome is duplicate the CBOs and not touch a single thing except DOUBLE the budget to the point where i had 10 CBOS spending $100 daily or so making about 2-5K in sales with 3+ ROAS.

Anyways, I tried to duplicating my winning CBOS even with the same budget but I realized that most of them end up doing absolutely terrible compared to the original CBO and sometimes even affects the original CBO negatively.. For example if I duplicated the winning CBO today BOTH may do terribly tomorrow. Another thing I realized is that the CBO will do bad one day than amazing the next- evening out for the week and remaining profitable. Basically kind of inconsistent from day to day but still profitable...

This kinda freaks me out because with the first winner I had, I just kept duplicating the first testing CBO with higher budgets and they all did fairly the same Return and consistent sales, 10% give or take.

Now down to the question... How do you guys think I should scale this? Should I duplicate that CBO again for the third time and add a higher budget? Or just increase the budget by 20% daily? Also Have you guys noticed the CBOs being inconsistent lately as well?

Looking forward to hearing back from you guys.The Best Way to Scale Winning CBOS with 3+ROAS"

659,shopify,"Lookalike audiences are overrated... sometimes.

&amp;#x200B;

I've seen so many ad accounts that are struggling to get just their first 50 sales from Facebook ads, and most of their audiences are Lookalike audiences created from data that they do not have enough of.

&amp;#x200B;

I understand how Lookalike audiences can sound great in theory... you tell Facebook to use the pixel data from the 30 purchases you have on your store to turn those 30 customers into millions of similar customers.

&amp;#x200B;

But the reality is... if you don't give Facebook enough data in terms of *quantity* AND *quality*, that Lookalike audience will not perform well. Something that people often neglect is the data that Facebook has accumulated for many years. And that is interest based audiences.

&amp;#x200B;

[Here are some results comparing interest ad sets to a Lookalike audience ad set](https://i.imgur.com/Ndv6gBD.png)

&amp;#x200B;

This ad account was relying heavily on Lookalike audiences before I started working on it, so we left one of those ad sets on to see if it would be beaten by an interest audience. And it was 3 times.

&amp;#x200B;

If you have experienced similar results when launching ads towards Lookalike audiences, then you can either

1. **Try a different type of Lookalike audience (different data source or different percentage) with the same budget**
2. **Use that budget towards an interest audience instead**

&amp;#x200B;

The problem with Lookalike audiences is that it can cost you a lot of money to know what that sweet spot combination of data source and percentage point is. This is because of the quality and quantity required.

&amp;#x200B;

**Scenario 1 (High quality, low quantity):** You've gotten 20 sales on your store of your perfect customer. Creating a purchase Lookalike might not work well without more data (or it could work, you never know unless you test it).

&amp;#x200B;

**Scenario 2 (High quantity, low quality):** You've had 20,000 visitors to your website in the last 90 days. But what if only 0.2% of them are customers. That would probably not work either due to the low amount of quality buyers in that audience.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's the take home with this...

* Don't neglect interest audiences in favor of Lookalikes all the time
* Don't always assume that a purchase Lookalike audience will always outperform a traffic or add to cart Lookalike audience

&amp;#x200B;

Hope that helps! I'm happy to answer any specific questions you have.For Shopify stores using Lookalike audiences in their Facebook Ads"

671,shopify,I'm playing around with some logos I've created in Canva and trying to add a fairly wide logo.  I'm using the debut theme and trying to set my logo from the left and I've set it to the maximum custom width of 25px but it's still only takes up around 1/6 of the page.  Is there a way to edit this and make it wider in debut as I can't properly make out the font on mobile at the moment.Adding logo issues

673,shopify,"Hi Guys,  


Im having a little bit of a head scratcher with how Shopify handles different situations for Refunds / Returns and Exchanges.  


Straight refunds are fair enough - the customer has sent back the product and wants a refund. We receive the product back and process the refund.  


An exchange however is a little confusing, we receive back the product, remove the item from the original order, add a new item - and collect the balance of whats owed or refund whats left over. But not always does Shopify give us the option to capture payment for this.  


Editing an order is another issue for us - a customer gets in contact before shipment to say they wanted a different size for example - we remove the item from the order and restock it, and add a new item. It doesn't seem to be calculating the balance correctly - it often asks for more money from the customer.  


What are your correct procedures for doing this, maybe we are going about restocking / adding or removing products from an order incorrectly.  


This is for the base Shopify with no additional applications.  


ThanksShopify Refund / Return / Exchange query."

675,shopify,"Came across this article and thought I'd share. Summary below, [link to dig deeper](https://www.mayfield.com/mayfield-ecommerce-of-the-future-forum/) and not just read the headlines if that's your jam.

2020 has left an enduring mark on the consumer landscape. Years of change have happened in weeks, and products rarely bought online are now ecommerce staples. Q2 2020 saw a 44% YoY growth of U.S. online sales, and eCommerce will be more than 19% of all retail for 2020, up from 14% in 2019. However, as traditional comes back online in 2021, its impact on eCommerce remains to be seen.

Key Takeaways

* eCommerce needs agility and flexibility now more than ever. Adapting to sudden change on the fly is no longer optional.
* Go custom to compete with Amazon. Real enthusiasts who know their stuff care about the brand they buy. People go to Amazon to save money on products they have already identified, but it‚Äôs rarely the place they start with net new discovery.
* D2C is coming into its own, but it has become clear that you can‚Äôt rely on brick and mortar or Amazon. D2C needs its own channel.
* Security is a rising priority. Ransomware is everywhere and businesses are very vulnerable.
* Consumer expectations around precision have changed. People want to know when their packages are arriving, and specifically where they are in the process. They also want speed. Many customers will buy a lesser brand if they know it will arrive sooner.
* Segmentation is critical around customer acquisition. Marketing to the right segments either based on past sales, views, stage of the customer journey, or other factors is the way of the future.Ecommerce of the Future Forum"

678,shopify," I struggled with Facebook ads and choosing the right strategy to test products and campaigns for the first few years of trying to run an eCommerce store. I have finally landed on a strategy that works well and is showing me great results and I wanted to share it with you guys. These results are actually achieved with a private-labeled but not proprietary brand, but if you are running an even stronger business model - you should be able to use this for WAY better results.

Proof: [February Sales](https://imgur.com/a/WDIWEBk) (This screenshot was taken halfway through the month, close to doing 60k at this point)

What may surprise you is **this strategy isn‚Äôt extremely complicated and doesn‚Äôt involve spending hours and hours on end in your ads manager** trying to micromanage the Facebook ai (hint, let the ai do the work for you)

The results pictured are ONLY using interest-based testing and I am currently not running a single lookalike audience.

I wanted to make this post before I launched lookalikes showing you what is possible with just top of funnel interest-based campaigns (I have one basic retargeting campaign running right now, but 95% of the sales are cold traffic)

The Strategy is broken out into two phases: testing and scaling and I made a quick video in the ads manager detailing exactly how to implement it:

Video: [Link](https://youtu.be/MplflU9ZqnU)

This testing and scaling strategy is not only easy to implement but it‚Äôs also super easy to manage because you don‚Äôt have hundreds of campaigns and different objectives to monitor and optimize.

I really hope this helps with your Facebook ads strategy and helps you absolutely crush it this spring. As always, don‚Äôt hesitate to reach out or comment any questions below and I will do my best to answer.

PS. Some of you may already know this, and I want to give a ton of credit to Nick Peroni for coming up with this strategy (I tweaked it a bit to suit my own needs), but I just wanted to show that implemented properly it can absolutely crush it.$30,000 in 2 Weeks - The Complete Easy Peazy Testing/Scaling Strategy üöÄ"
679,shopify,"What you are probably missing to become successful at ecommerce?

In this post, I‚Äôm going to explain what exactly I have changed in my approach **to get to $65k in Sales** in 2 months. I‚Äôve been in the game for over 1.5 years with very inconsistent results, until in last October, I realized that if I don‚Äôt change my approach, I am destined to never become profitable.

* **First problem** was the fact that I was **losing too much on testing** because I was hoping that the product will start doing better If I let the campaign run for 1 more day and 1 more after that and so on. So, instead of spending a maximum of $100 on testing the product, some failed product tests cost me upwards of $800 and more. Thus, I needed to implement a clear strategy to determine when to cut the losses and move on.
* **Second problem was that I was copying** and pasting the content and ads of the competitors and was hoping that if a product is a winner, it will make me rich anyway. This was obviously a huge mistake, because my ad quality was crappy and the CPMs and CTRs were extremely poor, and my landing pages were also weaker because they weren‚Äôt unique or original.
* **Third problem** is that I was always using **saturated products**, and even when I was profitable during testing, I was always failing to scale the product because the audiences that I was targeting already saw this same exact ad and same exact product countless of times.

So, given all these weaknesses of mine, I decided that it is important to drastically change my approach and starting to put in more time for building out a decent looking general store, writing my own product descriptions, making my own video ads and most importantly, selecting the profitable medium high-ticket niche and test unique products that were not tested before by others. Initially, results were quite unsatisfactory, but every day I was improving at a great pace, and within the last week of November, **I finally found a winner.**

At this stage, I decided that it is important for me to get outside help with scaling the product, because I already have had failures trying to scale good performing products, so, I outsourced my ads management and focused on improving my store and improving my conversion rates and AOV. This was the best decision as my ads finally started to perform consistently and I was not stressed out and panicking about my next steps with my ads strategy.

To sum up, this post was written to remind my fellow entrepreneurs to reflect on their weaknesses, and to try to improve on them, turn them into your strengths and outsource the rest, so that you could focus on what you can do the best. I‚Äôm constantly getting requests to review the stores and the ads that the beginners are doing and I see that almost all of them follow the route that I described above and almost never get satisfactory results. Long gone are the days when you could just set up a store in one day, run ads and become profitable. Ecommerce has evolved so much and turned into an extremely competitive business, so, if you are not ready to put in your best effort and stand out from the rest, I would wholeheartedly suggest you to try and find another thing to do, because you are inevitably going to lose a lot of money and will not even learn from the price you paid.

But I have no had one sale, which is very unusual. I run a case website, [tronscases.com](https://tronscases.com) which typically gets a sale when it gets around 100-150 visitors. I normally ran ADS on Pinterest (didn't do well) and my Facebook AD account was disabled at the time (no longer is, got it back a few days ago.)

It's quite honestly odd why I'm not getting a single sale, had tons of add-to carts and a good bit of ""reached checkout"" but nobody checked out. I also use an app that allows me to watch what visitors do live, they seem to look through the products add to the cart then leave. I also can see what device they use Apple or Android. There was a large number of Android users that visited the site from India, South America, and Africa. I searched what the most popular phone companies were and it was Samsung, Huawei, and Xiaomi. I added a bunch of those cases to my site, but they just do the same thing, look at them and maybe add them to the cart.

My checkout works fine, I've had sales before. I even checked myself. It's all very strange, I'm about to try a different AD with different interests. If anyone could help me out, I would appreciate it.My AD is doing extremely well but no conversions"

Hi all

I have an issue that I have been having trouble finding an answer to.¬†

We sell online all year long, and ship from our office/warehouse.¬† We also sell at festivals that run 8-9 weekends long - we use the Shopify POS system for this. We sell at 6 of these a year.¬† When we setup the festivals, we take stock from our warehouse (leaving stock at the warehouse for online orders) and restock our booth every weekend.¬† The festival stock stays at the festival for the full run, and is not available for fulfilling online orders.¬†¬†

Here is our issue.¬† We would like a way to setup our POS to only show what we have at the festival.¬† We sell a large variety of items and only take a small selection to the festivals, frequently things are rung up incorrectly at the festival which messes up our inventory, and we sometimes restock the wrong items.¬†

Another issue we have is this - we sometimes have stock of an item at a festival but not at the warehouse.¬† It appears to our online customers that we have stock of an item. but it's possible that all stock of that item has been taken to restock the festival.¬† Again - this causes issues with inventory, and customer satisfaction.¬†¬†

Previously we have created duplicate items, and made them only available at a certain location and only on POS.¬† This worked fairly well but it's pretty time consuming.¬† I feel like there much be a better solution to this!

If you got this far, thanks for reading along and I hope I made sense!

Thanks in advance for any helpOnline store and temporary festival sales"

We have had Shopify working as our order management system since a few years ago. 

Everything is going as good as it could, the main issue we are currently facing which I can't seem to find a fix for is that some clients lose their carts randomly. 

I have a persistent cart App installed and it still happens. 

I'm trying to scour the internet regarding this issue but everything that I found is about actual cart abandonment but not about clients losing their carts. 

I'm aware of Shopify's 14 days cart retention but I have clients who have lost their cart after only 4-5 days. 

If any one has had the smae issue, how did you fix it.
