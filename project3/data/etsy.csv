0,Etsy,"Hi! Welcome to the monthly critique request thread. When you post asking for a critique remember there's certain rules you must follow:

You must come with at least one specific question. No ""I just opened my shop, what should I fix?"" If that is your question you probably want to ask how you can improve your tags, or photos, or titles, or descriptions.

Let us know how long you've been open and if you're using Promoted Listings.

If you are possibly infringing on another parties intellectual property it will likely be addressed in the critique. Requests that devolve into discussions or arguments about infringement will be removed. We don't support the unlicensed use of other's intellectual property.

If you are found to be reselling non-handmade products your posts will be removed. We don't support resellers.

Before you ask for help, especially if you're new to selling, give yourself a quick shop critique with the high points most new sellers miss:

* Am I using phrases that apply to your item instead of single word tags?

* Am I using all 13 tag spaces?

* Am I using all 10 image slots?

* Are my pictures correctly white balanced? Do they look good next to other pictures in search results?

* Am I using most of the characters they give me for my title, stuffing it full of my tags and keywords?

* Do I have policies and my about page filled out? Do I have a banner, a shop icon, and my user pic in the about section?

* Am I infringing on anyone's copyright, trademark, or right to publicity? Is my artwork original?

2,Etsy,"Somewhere along the way, this sub has become dominated by posts either by sellers decrying the ""worst buyer ever"" (bonus points if you call them a Karen), or by buyers with the patience of a saint asking timorously if they should open a case despite not having received the item they were promised six months ago. I think the former likely influences the latter - the prevalence of stories about nightmare buyers seems to make people think that a seller has to have threatened your life in writing before it's okay to open a case!

Buyers: if a seller is fobbing you off; pushing a shipping deadline back over and over; has sent you the wrong thing and is refusing to help; is ignoring your messages and you've still not received what you paid for; *it's okay to open a case!* Yes, do try patience and understanding first; don't open a case without making an attempt to contact the seller; do in most situations message the seller first before leaving a one star review to give them the chance to remedy things (not to extort them, but to make them aware there's an issue). But remember that this is a *business transaction*. This isn't Sunday afternoon visiting at the retirement home with your grandma where opening a case is the equivalent of flinging a cup of tea in her face. Yes, you have the responsibility to be reasonable as a buyer, but you are *not* individually responsible for the success of a shop.

I just see so many people incredibly reticent to stand up for themselves when the seller is blatantly taking the piss. Yes, it's mostly sellers here, and yes they're very vocal about bad buyers - everyone needs a rant from time to time - but that doesn't make all complaining buyers bad! Some sellers are bad too, and when you come across one you don't have to post here asking for permission to advocate for yourself.""Can I ask for a refund?"" ""Should I open a case?"" ""I don't want to ruin their shop!"""
3,Etsy,"Just did a breakdown on the economics on my shop and it's not looking good anymore..

My latest sale brought in $39.98 and I have their recommended free shipping over $35 turned on.

Lets see where we land..

* Inventory $6.00
* Shipping $10.80
* Packaging $5.40
* (Mandatory) Advertising $4.80
* Transaction Fee $2.00
* Payment Processsing Fee $1.45
* Listing $0.40
* Renewal $0.20

Net Profit $8.93..

Absolutely insane.. I went months not realizing how bad it's gotten. As a vintage seller, all I'm doing is finding inventory and packing boxes, I have absolutely no idea how those of you who actually have to create your items are doing it with these margins but I commend you on successfully doing so. For over a decade I'd try to purchase items at about 50% of my final sale cost.. doing so now results in a large net loss.Etsy with mandatory off-site ads is an absolute profit vampire."
4,Etsy,"I opened up a shop this year and made about $11k in revenue in 2020. First time small business owner so doing taxes for this is completely new to me. I have read that Etsy is now supposed to be collecting and remitting sales tax for orders automatically.

I'm looking at my financial statements for the year and things aren't adding up. Under the Fee and Tax column in my payment account page every transaction has two different charges from Etsy - one for ""sale"" and the other for ""transaction"". My assumption is that the ""sale"" fee that Etsy charges me is for sales tax and the ""transaction"" fee is the cut that they take for every transaction.

The problem is that the ""sale"" fee doesn't match the sales tax that was charged to my customers for each order. So is that ""sale"" fee not for sales tax? 

To complicate things further, I tried exporting the CSV from Settings &gt; Download Data &gt; Orders (2020) page like so many tutorials suggest and in that CSV file the entire sales tax column is showing as blank for all of my orders. I know for a fact this isn't correct because I've looked at each order and they all have sales tax added onto them.

So what the hell is going on here? Do I have to pay all of these back taxes in sales tax to the state when I file? Or is Etsy paying them? 

And FWIW Etsy freaking SUCKS. I hate this platform, the fees they take are ridiculous and the tools they offer are AWFUL.Desperately need help with taxes for Etsy shop"

6,Etsy,"I posted at the beginning of this week about my personalised Mother’s Day onesie for my son which didn’t arrive by the date, even though I ordered it in plenty of time. It was due to be dispatched a couple of days after I ordered it and the seller was a little rude when I messaged (Thurs before Mother’s Day) to check whether it was going to be on its way soon. After asking for a refund last Sunday (Mother’s Day) due to not receiving it, the only response I have had from the seller was a generic message saying that a parent has died unexpectedly, all Mother’s Day orders were dispatched on time and someone will be fulfilling all other orders. 

On the advice of someone here, I gave it a few days because Hermes (seller said they were the carrier) can be unpredictable. The onesie turned up yesterday, almost a week after Mother’s Day. Here are my issues:

- It was not sent via Hermes. It was sent Royal Mail, I think 1st class. It also said “post by 20th March” on it, which was yesterday, so I strongly suspect it‘s only recently been dispatched. The seller has not been truthful here. 

- It is appalling quality. I only undid one of the poppers and that one fell off. 

- To top it all off, my son’s name is spelled incorrectly on it. It’s not an unusual name but there are two ways of spelling it and both spellings are commonly used. I checked and I spelled it correctly on the order. 

I suspect that this has been hastily done and only dispatched a couple of days ago. I obviously understand given the circumstances that it hasn’t been easy but I would have much preferred my order to have been cancelled and refunded than receiving something totally useless  a week late. 

I have left a 1 star review and in it said I will be asking for a refund. The shop is “taking a break” at the moment, which is fine, but that could be weeks and I don’t know if there’s a refund window for purchases. 

So is it best to open a case?Should I open a case or contact the seller again?"

8,Etsy,"It's my first time sending a parcel from UK to USA and after research I am still unsure whether the purchaser of my product will have to pay additional taxes on it. It is a small framed artwork valued at around £20. My understanding is that it may be up to US customs as to how much to tax it depending on the item? But if they do get taxed is it likely to be a significant amount and is this something I should bring up with the customer and offer to pay for, or is this just something that is widely accepted when sending internationally.Import tax on Parcels sent to USA?"
9,Etsy,My account has finally been reopened after it was suspended for a day and now I haven’t had a single sale and my traffic and favorites are down to where I started practically.

18,Etsy,"Hi ! So, I recently learned that your keywords must be in the language of your shop to work. My shop language is in French, but I do digital prints, so a lot of them have sayings in English. Also, I feel like there isn’t really keywords for this niche in French, and most of my customers are from the us and not from my country. The problem is, right now, none of my traffic comes from keywords/search on Etsy so I feel like I would be much more successful if I could get sales directly from search. Should I switch my shop language to English ? If you’re an Etsy seller whose shop isn’t in English, what is your strategy and are you successful ?Etsy SEO by language"

20,Etsy,"Help! My buyer didn't pay customs and parcel stuck.

I run UK based shop, I got order for three heavy knitted items to be shipped to France. I have chosen DPD as the cheapest and safest shipping option and shipped within 1 day, insured (at my own expense) and with all the customs papers correctly filled. Parcel made it to France super quickly, I was able to track it, I of course provided tracking number to Etsy and also DM it to the buyer.

Days went by and parcel didn't move in tracking. After customs being sorted out, no progress whatsoever. I eventually contacted the buyer. And she was like ""oh so this is why X (DPD's French partner) asked me to pay customs. Now I understand it is THE parcel from you. Well, I had issues with paying the customs"". And you tell me NOW ? She also claimed her tracking didn't work (it worked for me, in case of issues she could have contacted me).  And that she thought that customs were included in what she paid, despite me sending her a very clear message saying YOU MAY HAVE TO PAY EXTRA CUSTOM CHARGES ONCE IT ARRIVES. She took some actions in order to clarify it with X services after my message. At least that's what I was told. But it was too late to pay customs and she was told parcel will be returned to sender. She apologised etc. Now this parcel is most likely lost, I'm in touch with DPD customer service hoping it will be returned to me somehow one day. Buyer however had a very unpleasant convo with me yesterday when we discussed circumstances of the whole event. She claims that she receives many parcels from abroad so it's **obvious** that she didn't immediately connect customs issue with THIS parcel, duhh. But if it was me, and I had issues with completing customs payment, I would find which parcel it is that I can't pay for and at least would inform the seller ! Buyer insists she did everything to receive the parcel and I can't agree. Am in the wrong here ? She got ultra upset and offended when I suggested that there was not enough done at her end in order to receive the parcel and avoid current situation. Because I really feel that I did everything I could, and could have done more if I was informed ON TIME that she can't have her customs paid due to some email-phone number issue. So yeah, am I wrong here ? Btw I'm assuming she's telling the truth about inability to pay the customs due to some error, although her mentioning how high the customs charges are few times and suggesting that I could re-send it once it's back to me with other services because she heard it is cheaper and customs also could be lower, is kind of a red flag for me and makes me question her explanationBuyer didn't pay customs, didn't inform me, now parcel is probably lost"
21,Etsy,"So I was scrolling through stuff on Etsy to randomly shop when one of the pictures shown for a popular search named ""Collar Ring"" showed a boob, nipples and all! Lol .

22,Etsy,"So about a month ago I got an order (a bronze sword) from a person that lives in Australia. My shop is located in Greece (I make handmade bronze statues that are 100% made by me using the method of casting). 

Everything went smoothly , the item was shipped in time etc. Suddenly 2 days ago the buyer sents me a message demanding a 35$ refund because as he said ""The item doesn't match its' description and looks better in the pictures."" I have to tell you that we sent him the exact same sword he requested and in the listing details the size of the sword is crearly stated correctly (9.5 inches in length). 

When we told him that the statue is actually the correct size he requested a refund. We gladly accepted ofcourse but he demanded we pay for the shipping costs as well. Now I have to point out that in our shop policies we have stated that we accept refunds/returns as long as the buyer pays for the shipping cost.

Ofcourse he refused to pay the shipping and called us a ""ripoff"". He made a case on the sale and then gave us a bad review as well on Facebook.

We messaged him with screenshots and photos of the same sword in our workshop that prove that the sword is actually the correct size but he said that he will contact PayPal and he will do it the hard way now that we didn't pay him back the 35$.

Is there something we can do? He clearly has bad intentions and I don't wanna see a bad review on etsy. I have made more than 250 sales so far for the past 4 years and have never had such a bad experience with a buyer.A buyer made a case on my shop"

24,Etsy,"This girl is the sweetest buyer I’ve ever met. She ordered a customized picture frame from me. I shipped it all the way from Toronto, Canada to Mississippi and sadly it arrived broken. 

She said this sometimes happens with her UPS packages as the delivery person just drops them and they shatter. I felt so terrible and immediately offered to refund her or replace it at no cost. I profusely apologized and thanked her for being so nice. 

That’s when she thanked ME for being so nice because apparently the last time she ordered something from Etsy and it was broken on arrival the seller basically said she’s SOL and made her pay again to replace it. 

How sellers can do that is beyond me. I understand things break during shipping and it’s beyond our control - yes it sucks, but I definitely don’t think it’s the buyers responsibility to buy it again if they want it. Broken packages are a cost of business.

I wouldn’t even fathom making a buyer pay again for something when it’s technically my fault it broke and they hadn’t even touched it before it broke. I don’t just do this because I don’t want a bad review but I just can’t in good conscience make someone spend hard earned money twice on something that’s my fault. 


TLDR; package shattered in the mail and the buyer said thanks for being so nice for offering the replace it at no cost because the last Etsy seller she had a broken package with said she had to pay again if she wanted a replacement.A package I shipped arrived broken - and the buyer is thanking ME for being so nice for offering to replace it for free?

25,Etsy,For context text I ordered something on January 8th. The things takes a month to cure and such so I expected to get it before Valentine's day and then that came and went. I have contacted the seller multiple times they ensured me the first time that they were sending it out that week. A week later I contacted again asking for tracking information got none and was told it would be shipped out in a week. 10days and I still have no items and no shipping info. I feel bad but I feel like I've been more than understanding. Another mention their shop is literally a town over from where I live so even with shipping it shouldn't take long once they send it.Should I open a case?
26,Etsy,"Hi everyone! 
I'm a beadsmith (I guess that's the term?), who mainly designs and makes goth/victorian style jewelry. 
I'm fairly new to Etsy as a selling platform, mainly because I was previously unable to ship items abroad (I'm based in Argentina and it's a nightmare to try and sell outside of our country), but I've finally found a trustworthy  and efficient way of doing it and I've begun my attempt at going worldwide.
Thing is, I have been selling domestically for a few years and have been lucky enough to amass a few loyal customers. The question is, is it important for potential buyers out there to find a section with ""happy clients"" to look through in my media? Would it help build people's trust that I indeed fullfil my orders and deliver what I advertise? 
Thanks so much for your feedback!Is it important to share client pictures?"
27,Etsy,"Lets say I try to sell custom PC cases for PC hardware enthusiasts, but need a few small electronic parts such as a power button/USB, etc. Is my only option to go to AliExpress, or amazon and buy really cheap Chinese knockoff brands that last a week before falling apart according to review?

31,Etsy,"Is there a difference in visibility between offering free delivery for everything as opposed to free delivery if you spend over a certain amount or buy a set amount of items? 

I currently offer free delivery on everything but when people are only buying one pair of studs it makes up a large proportion of the revenue to offer free delivery. I'm just scared that if I stop offering it that it will hurt my shop as I keep hearing how much etsy prioritises it. I was thinking of offering free delivery when you spend over a certain amount, but does this still garner that same priority appearance and does etsy perceive this as free delivery if people search for that?Does free delivery actually make a difference?"
32,Etsy,"Hey everyone. Sorry if this may sound like a dumb question but I'm trying to order an epoxy table worth C$1400 from a seller based in Turkey and I'm trying to figure out the customs on it. So I asked seller if they can lower the price on receipt so I don't have to pay 30% on 1400. Seller told me they can't do it as price is marked by Etsy but they'll mark the item as gift. They said they've done this before with previous customers in Canada and they were not asked to pay any customs. I, however, am still unsure of it.

Has anyone tried to do this or know how customs on gifts work in Canada? If I buy a similar table from Canada, it'll cost me a lot more (around C$5000). I'll buy the table anyway as it's still cheaper than buying it from Canada but I'mjust trying to save some money on customs. If anyone has a suggestion, please share it.

34,Etsy,"Lemme preface by saying i try my best to go above and beyond for customers. when something is their fault (i.e, wrong address given or wrong color ordered ), Depending on your attitude with me ill do you a solid and resend an item minus the cost of shipping instead of making them rebuy it or something since i wont lose a huge profit and because being nice is easy and feels good.

Enter Karen, ordered from me and gave me the wrong address. Only the city was wrong though, no big deal, but street address was correct so now its in the correct city after it bouncing around and not moving from the PO for like a week. She messaged me asking where her candle was, i nicely explained that it seems there was a delay because the city she put down was wrong but that its in the correct city now, apologized for the delay, and its still on its way. She said the address was right and that the city she put was an area inside of the correct city (which its not, its literally a completely different city at the end of the state and confirmed by usps as being a different zipcode) and that ""well ive always used that address before and it worked!"" (Because the PO figured out what city you MEANT and EVENTUALLY figured it out). She then said it needs to be delivered that same day since shes going out of town as if im the shipping fairy and can hand deliver things on command. Basically said its still on its away and that if ends up not being deliverable (which honestly it shouldn't be) and comes back to me, ill resend it with the right city or just refund her minus shipping.
 
Got a snarky one word response yesterday which i didnt respond to, until she just messaged me today and said still no candle with a snarky emoji. Not much else i can tell her because its still in transit so i repeated what i said and told her to just check the tracking number for updates.

At this point im sick of her attitude so im like...should i just let her leave an inevitable one star that ill publically respond to professionally and kindly or should i refund and cancel her order even though its still on its way just to get her off my back? Im also worried she'll open a case which ill most likely win because i can prove i shipped it on time to the address she gave me but i dont want it to affect my shop.Should I prepare for a 1 star or refund her and let her get free product?"

37,Etsy,"Hello everyone, hope all is well.

I made a purchase last night on Etsy that I was extremely excited about obtaining for my upcoming birthday. I paid via Apple Pay as I have done with many past purchases without any issues but I woke up this morning to an email stating the order I made last night was canceled with the reasoning being that 'This order was cancelled and refunded based on specifically-reviewed criteria designed to help protect our marketplace.'

Now the shop is very new, only 1 sale, so I contacted them and they told me Etsy described the reasoning for the cancelation was because it was an unauthorized purchase. I authorized the purchase so I took my question to Etsy and am waiting for a response from them but I thought while I wait I would make a post here to see if anyone had dealt with a similar situation.This order was cancelled and refunded based on specifically-reviewed criteria designed to help protect our marketplace."

42,Etsy,My photos on eBay look great. They are very clear and the zoom feature works great. No blur. They are quality photos taken with my iphone X. I imported my listings from eBay into Sellbrite. Then I used the feature on Sellbrite to import the listings into Etsy. I had planned to use the sync feature in Sellbrite so once an item sells it will be removed form the other platform. The photos on Etsy look absolutely horrible. They are blurry even before the zoom feature is used and once zoomed they are really terrible. It is so bad I refuse to even use them. Very unprofessional. Can anything be done to fix this? Please don't say take new photos because I have a lot of listings and that is not happening. I sadly just won't use Etsy if I can't figure out a solution for my existing listings / photos. Anyone have a similar experience? Thanks!I'm using Sellbrite to import my eBay listings to Etsy. Once the Etsy listing is live the photos on Etsy look blurry. Terrible!

I have an Etsy seller account as an individual and want to add my business information to my account.

The shop has almost reach its limit as an individual account and will have to be a business account before this Mother's Day. I don't want my shop will be suspended because Etsy won't allow my business information since it's registered under another person's name.

Is it possible for me to add the business with the other person's information as the owner since I follow this shop's sales completely. Does Etsy allow each incorporator have their own etsy shops, or do I need to open an account under the other person's name.

I didn't think I could reach the limit before I got my SSN so didn't think about this before.

The item in question has a 4-6 week processing time but i've been busting my butt lately to catch up on orders before my baby is due and shipped out this person's item an entire MONTH early. After initially sending me a message asking why their order took so long to get to them (item only spent 3 days in transit before being delivered), I let them know that it was in fact shipped out early and they never responded. Now they've left a review stating ""the item took nearly a month to arrive, &amp; the seller did not communicate with me at all about the delay"". They are also upset that an item included for FREE with their order was not the color they liked. 

Probably going to go the good old public shaming route with my response &amp; let them know AGAIN that their item shipped an entire month ahead of schedule but wow am I tired of dealing with customers like this.

[https://www.etsy.com/shop/RopesByEDK?ref=shop\_sugg](https://www.etsy.com/shop/RopesByEDK?ref=shop_sugg) \- MATURE LINK

We are a small husband and wife team who make ***Damn Good Bondage Rope***, out of our shop in southcoast Massachusetts! (No we're not from Boston! XD). We dye, spin by hand, and condition two different fibers of rope, in over 50 colors. We also dye and re-sell manufactured ropes, in over 16 different colors with two rainbow options.

We just hit out **10,000th sale**, and we are completely overwhelmed. Six years since I took a trip down ""do-it-yourself"" lane, we are at the best point in our business journey ever. I just got done with building a new shop building on our property dedicated to this business, and moved our operations out of the basement, and sun room, and second bedroom, and dining room (only after resupply deliveries).... you get the idea!

Being an adult rated business through this pandemic has brought on major highs, and major lows. We currently have 52 active listings, which is an all time high for us. We did the majority of our business with \~35 ish listings.

My wife quit her job to work this full time, hopefully I will soon!

&amp;#x200B;

This will lead me into my ""Narrative for discussion"",

***How do we handle making products to order, with repeatability, so that orders are similar over years?***

**-This is specifically related to dyeing materials;**

I know there are plenty of you who are mixing dyes and rinsing fabrics on here! We have dyed dozens of different mediums using 5 different dyeing techniques and currently process 10-20 dye baths per week across two main different fibers!

* We use dye cards to record each and every single batch. We monitor quantities of dye, fixative, water temperature etc. If we have a batch that is different, we double check our temperatures, double check and be sure we grabbed the correct measuring cup. It really helps us isolate and reduce wasted material!
* Pre-wash your material!!! I cannot stress this enough. Washing material with something that removes oils is key to getting even and consistent dyeing.

**-This is related to the workflow on your end;**

* We use every single order flow option Etsy gives us. (And I wish we had more). This whole process really helps us to focus in on what needs to be done now vs not a priority. It allows us to stay on a singular task and be more efficient with our time.
   * Our new orders section is filtered and emptied every day, or more frequently.
   * Orders that need to be dyed go into a category ""To be dyed""
   * Orders ready to spin go to ""Ready to spin!""
   * We also use two other workflows;
      * A ""Todays Worklist""
      * A ""Tomorrow worklist""
      * This lets us parse out and plan our week several days in advance.
   * And Finally we use a ""Ready to ship"" category to dump orders into as they are spun and/or direct ready-to-ship items!

If you made it here to the end, thank you so much for reading! I would love to answer any other questions I can to help!

&amp;#x200B;

*I remember saying after 1k, ""It will be forever before I hit 10k"". Now I say with certainty... I can't wait to write my post for 100K. Because I will, and it will be soon!*

71,Etsy,"I guess this is mostly a rant?

I have a shop where I sell sterling silver jewellery, and my biggest sellers are two different rings. The rings are premade, truthfully, bought from a reputable seller, and I fit the stones. They are stamped 925 silver. 

A buyer aggressively messaged me this afternoon telling me it clearly wasnt sterling silver and it was fake, as it has tarnished after a week. The tarnish mark is a blotch. Her aggression instantly upset me, but I politely explained that sterling silver can tarnish when subjected to certain chemicals - e.g. strong bleach, but a quick polish with toothpaste would easily buff it out. I suspect the buyer has used a chemical due to the shape of the tarnish mark. 

She wont try to buff it out as apparently the silver has ""chipped and cracked away"" and now will leave me horrible feedback. I'm not a busy shop. I have just shy of 30 sales and five 5* reviews. I do this for a bit of fun on the side as I build my experience making jewellery and was looking at expanding, as I have learned to smith my own simple bands. 

I just dont know how to reply politely. I am confident that my jewellery is 925 silver - I cant wear or really handle plated jewellery as the other metals upset my skin, and I wear what I make. I buy from a reputable seller. This woman hasnt even requested a refund and just seems to want to be aggressive and rude.

ETA: Have just realised she purchased as a guest, so one worry out of the way.

ETA 2: Thank you everyone for your help and advice, I have learned a lot. I calmed down and responded this afternoon, explaining if she returned the ring I would either refund her or polish/replace. She's instead chosen to keep the ring and try polish it herself? I have no idea anymore. 
I have purchased a silver testing kit for future use.

This item that was accidentally cancelled was the last in stock, so it shows up as unavailable.

Will the item be put back up automatically after the refund goes through, or should I ask the seller to repost it?

I’m asking because I don’t want to look extra dumb as I already spoke to the seller so it would be very awkward.

78,Etsy,"Hi,

  I'm trying to figure if I would draw more customers with lower prices/shipping fee or higher prices/free shipping. I make hand forged ironwork, so all of my larger items $35+ like fire pokers have had great success with free shipping. I am more concerned about my smaller items that are under $20, likes hooks and bottle openers. For example, I can charge $7.50 for a hook with $3.75 shipping, and I am making a fair profit. However, when looking at similar successful shops on Etsy, some offer a similar hook for $7.50 but with free shipping. Now I feel like I need to offer free shipping just to compete with this shop. But doing so would cause me to make barely anything on the sold item between fees, shipping costs, and materials. Do customers really care that much when they see the free shipping banner? I do offer $35+ free shipping, and feel it might be a great way to get more items purchased since Etsy now does the item paring, but I wish they made a banner to show we have the guarantee.

I've been selling on Etsy since the end of Jan of this year and I had a few questions about what is legally required to sell items.

On Etsy, since our sales taxes are remitted/taken care of for sellers, I've read online that a Seller's Permit is not required because of that? Additionally, I live in California and I was wondering if a Business License was required if I'm ONLY selling on Etsy? I've read some forums online but I get mixed answers.

82,Etsy,"I’ve seen TikToks lately of people printing their own stickers lately (like those “thanks for shopping small”) and I always wanted to buy some so I thought wow why not make my own. I know this could be a very lucrative business if the price is right. I also have my own small business and figured I could use the printer to print shipping labels (I don’t do high volume at all but I figured by combining both of the reasons it would give me a good excuse for buying one). 

I’m looking at the MUNBYN label printer right now. I’m in Canada so on Amazon it’s about $220 and on the website directly it’s $176 with discounts. Does anyone know if you’re charged import fees when you buy directly off the website? I’m obviously hoping for the most cost effective printer and it looks like this brand is the cheapest and best selling. 

And just give me your overall review! Do you like it? Is it worth the money? Would you have bought a different one knowing what you know now? Is it easy to use? Do you only use it for shipping or for stickers too?

The item was 94 USD
They took 5USD in taxes
Then another 14USD from the off site ads thingy.

I don't understand this. The buyer was pretty sure that she only clicked the link I have shared.

Is this right? Or am I being ripped off?

I asked her to send proof of products as photo and she sent me the one she has in her car but refused to send me the other photo which her alleged boyfriend has. 
Claims she is on lockdown and cannot go outside because of her safety and has no local community box to receive or send mail back. 
I checked her neighbourhood area and there is obviously local community boxes. She is lying about not having one and lying about not being able to go outside when she obviously can. (Proof she is going outside because of the photo she sent in her car).

Also a few days ago I posted on here about an ""incident""/scam with another small business where we were supposed to do a product swap and she never sent the products (you can read it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Etsy/comments/m4x36l/soi_think_i_got_scammed_by_another_small_business/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share) if you want)...
Well, I messaged her today and she basically made up a bunch of excuses about being busy and my order being sent back to her...I gave up on that situation but she said something that kind of hurt...She basically told me that I didn't send her anything physical (because my business is printables and digital products lol) and that it was just a picture, and even tough it was pretty it was just a picture....referring to my custom illustration of her that took me 2 days to make ... And now I'm thinking maybe she's right and that's why no one really wants to buy my products... Should I just close the shop?

EDIT: OMG guys! I've read every single one of your comments and will respond to all of them next, but I just wanted to say thank you for your kind words and support! I woke up to a sale, 6 shop favorites and 423 views on my shop! As some of you pointed out, it is a really difficult time for everyone and it is not easy to have something that people feel like they NEED to buy in the current economy, but we have to keep going and someday it will pay off! Thank you!I'm thinking about closing my shop...I'm starting to feel really discouraged"
93,Etsy,"I bought something off of Etsy last month and paid in full via PayPal. The item was dispatched last week, but I’ve just received a message from the Royal Mail saying that there is an unpaid shipping fee that I have to pay otherwise the product will be sent back to the seller.

The only problem is the seller does not accept returns so I’m not really sure what to do. I don’t know if the responsibility rests upon me or the seller considering they’ve never mentioned an extra fee. I’m a first time Etsy buyer so if this is normal please tell me

Thank you :)New to Etsy and...confused?"
94,Etsy,"Hi! I’m based in MA and I am turning my Etsy shop into an LLC. I have 2 questions:

The lawyer I hired has advised me that I need to include the “LLC” in my shop name, business cards, logo, etc. I really don’t want to change the name or include it, is there a way around this? I rarely see shops that include it so I’d like to avoid it. 

Second, he told me that because I am selling to other states, I should check with those states to make sure there is nothing I need to file to legally sell there... but it’s an Etsy store. I sell to all 50 states and internationally, so...??

Thanks :)

Edit: I also realized that of course, Etsy doesn’t put spaces within shop names. So I would have to make the letters LLC part of my shop name, which would turn it into a nonsense word that is very hard to search for. I also looked through the ~700 shops I have favorited, and not a single one ended their name with LLC. So I’m going to have to stress to this lawyer how much this will affect my visibility - no one will know to search for it, and I also just don’t want to change the name to a long nonsense word.Filing as LLC"
95,Etsy,"So I had some available for deposit (not a ton) but I made a decent amount of sales today. I see my current balance is positive, but now my available for deposit amount is 0. Why is this?

I feel like I don't remember it being that way before, but maybe I just didn't pay attention..Available for deposit went down to 0?"

99,Etsy,"Hi all! First time posting here, I hope I’m using the right tag. I recently started a custom hand embroidery shop, and I received my first order!! 

So what I make is highly custom - I have to draw out the design first then hand embroider. The embroidery process typically takes 4-6 hours. 

I sent a pic of the design once it was complete and received confirmation from the buyer. However, I’m wondering if it’s best practice (or if it makes sense in my case) to also send a picture of the final product before shipping. Part of me would like to, to make sure it’s to their liking. However, it’s mostly unrealistic to make changes once it’s complete without tacking on another 1-3 hours of work. 

What do you guys think? Or for people with similar setups, what do you guys do?

Thanks so much!!For those who do custom orders - do you send a picture before shipping and allow for tweaks?"

101,Etsy,"**TL;DR: A strange case of a buyer claiming she received not what I sent. No real problem here.**

For the context: I am an artist and my style is somewhat difficult to imitate. I sell my original art as well as posters (which I print locally and send myself, so no 3rd party involved).

Just woke up (time difference) to a hysterical convo from a buyer, all caps etc, saying she received something totally different from what she ordered and please please could I help. Attached was a photo of a picture of the same theme that her order was (she ordered a *print* of a fish, and the picture was a *watercolor* (?) of exactly the same kind of fish, same color, but a bit different composition) clearly done by a child or a totally unprofessional person. Obviously not what I sent, but looked like someone made an effort to make it similar to mine, not seeing an original.

Me: ""This is definitely not what I sent. Can you take a picture of packaging?""

Buyer: ""Let me go check the package -maybe it was for another home"". 3 minutes later: ""Omg this is not for me I’ll have to return to office -I’m so sorry  I thought it was yours -can you tell me when will I receive my art work  -I’m so excited waiting for it that I just opened this package not  noticing it was not mine.""

Me: ""okay, hope you will get yours very soon. No worries""

I sent 3 orders to the US on the same day as hers, two of them delivered yesterday (got very positive feedback), so her order was indeed about to arrive. Normally I don't believe in this kind of coincidence (would you?), but it doesn't look like a scam either (or does it?). I karenchecked her (I do it routinely for all orders) and there's one normal review of hers, nothing strange.

Don't know what to think really. This is not a major issue for me (it was one of my cheapest listings anyway), just an uncanny feeling. Needed to vent it somehow.

Has anyone heard of anything like that? I had my share of difficult customers, so I thought I can hardly be surprised, but this was something!Impossible coincidence or a new type of scam?"

106,Etsy,"I have an Etsy shop that was (originally) meant to sell my personal crochet patterns and designs, as well as physical things that I crochet. Recently I got into making crochet kits and started a company that focuses primarily on crochet patterns, tutorials, and kits. On that site, I am a featured artist and feature other crochet artists as well.

I sell my kits and patterns on that site, but people often go through my personal Etsy to purchase as an alternative. As I am growing my new company brand, I was thinking of making a secondary Etsy shop to put the patterns and kits onto, this way I can somewhat distance my artist handle from my brand a bit and feature kits using patterns and tutorials that I am not the artist for (they are commissioned and I get permission for this via contract).

My secondary Etsy shop that fits the new company brand will have some of the same items as my artist handle (kits and patterns) but also some additional kits that I don't feel comfortable putting on my artist Etsy page. I would take new pictures and redesign these listings to look slightly different, but keep my original listings as well since they have been selling really well from Etsy search and I don't want to lose that traction either.

This also has the added benefit of having 2 of the same items listed from 2 different shops giving me twice the visibility in the search and discovery. The downside is having to re-grow my status through reviews, sales, etc, but I would still have my original Etsy listing too.

My question is this. Will I get in trouble for this since it will be essentially the same items for sale from the same seller (me), but in two different shops, even if the images, titles, and descriptions are slightly different? It feels morally questionable like I'm cheating the system a bit. Not enough to fully deter me but enough to see if I would get into trouble with Etsy themselves.

Would love any feedback on this! Thank you so much for reading!!Should I create a secondary Etsy Shop with the same items?"

Then, she messages me again with photos of the dress asking me to approve them before she ships them! So she hasn't even shipped them like she has said. She flat out lied to me. I called her out and she didn't even acknowledge her mistake. 

I want to report her but I also want my dress to get here. I'm worried that if I report her now she will just give me a refund and never send me the dress. I tried asking for a tracking number last night for this very reason (to ensure she actually ships it this time) but she hasn't given me one yet and I'm not totally convinced that she will.

So, I messaged the seller in a very friendly way and just asked if he had any shipping info he could share with me. That's when he apologized extensively and said that he was so busy that he forgot he even had a shop on Etsy. To make up for it, he even offered to add in some other gifts. I told him not to worry about it and to take it easy on himself because he sounded so busy, and we had a nice, cordial conversation. He told me that he would have my item in the mail by the next morning. 

It's March 17 now and the item has STILL not shipped. I'm very disappointed because I was quite looking forward to receiving it AND it was kinda expensive.

""I bought this sweatshirt as a gift and the recipient absolutely loves it. **Its** a very soft **materiel**, and the embroidery is incredibly well done. Everything about it is high **qualitey** and I couldn't recommend it enough.""

127,Etsy,"I recently purchased an item from Etsy for the first time and paid the suggested shipping fees alongside the purchase price of the item. I received an email from the seller asking for my phone number to aid in the shipping process, and then another email asking the below (paraphrased):

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;I will ship it in 2 days. If you wish I can ship by (mail carrier) , it arrives in 5 business days and it requires $20 more. I checked that you have bought the item from offsite ads , etsy receives 10% fee more for offsite ad sales . If you wish I can cancel the order , refund your money ( it may take a few days to transfer to your bank account ) and list it again for you and you make the purchase directly from etsy .This time you are required to pay only $10 more for expedited shipping . You will pay $20 instead of $10 for shipping .Thanks ,Seller

&amp;#x200B;

I am not sure what offsite ads means and, also, why I would have to cancel my order, reorder, and then pay more for the expedited shipping? Could I not just go with the standard shipping that I paid for through Etsy? What I suspect is that the item was listed offsite of Etsy, a service which costs the seller a set fee that they are hoping to avoid and will compensate me by subsidizing express shipping.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't particularly like the idea of having my order canceled and having to reorder the item while my funds are still not transferred back to me, but, maybe I purchased the item from the wrong link that wasn't etsy's home site and the seller is trying to save me money?

129,Etsy,"Hello everyone!

I hope you're all doing well. My shop sells body creams and perfume oils (and soon selling soap) made with locally-sourced goat's milk. Before I offered an unscented version of our body cream, I found that customers bought our Oatmeal Milk &amp; Honey body cream since it is a little more subtle. I've heard a lot of great, positive feedback from customers, but have also heard that it was stronger than they were expecting. This led me to the idea to offer a free sample, slash ""try before you buy"" type of thing, where I could send them a really small (0.25 oz) sample of the body cream before they purchased the whole 8 oz jar of it. 

I don't believe that Etsy allows you to offer anything for free, and the minimum is $0.20. Also, I'd hate for a customer to dislike the sample and leave a negative review for something that is literally free. 

Anyone have any ideas about how I can offer this while avoiding a negative review on a free sample? My only idea was to have them message me and let me know their address so that I can send it.

132,Etsy,"So I make photo albums and made a mistake on the listing description. I wrote that the photo album is A6 (which it is), but had the wrong dimensions listed out. Customer reached out after receiving the package and let me know that the dimensions were wrong and asked for an exchange. I apologized and offered an exchange for the photo album with correct dimensions (if she mailed back original album). Customer then responded and said she'd prefer the exchange due to a project she's working on, but wanted the exact placement of the patterned paper on the cover to match the original album. I said that's not possible due to the handmade nature of the patterned paper (each one is unique) and offered a full refund and to pay for the return shipping label. Now the customer wants me to provide photos of available paper so she can pick for the cover. This is turning into a custom order and while I understand the customer may be frustrated with me and my mistakes, I don't think I should entertain the idea of a custom order. (Full disclosure my shop does not offer refunds or exchanges or returns, but I felt obligated to try to resolve in the customer's favor due to my listing error)

If there is something that needs to be improved in my product, please feel free to let me know. If not, please take into consideration the impact on the seller when you leave an inaccurate review in the future. 

And it seemed a bit unprofessional to me? I just looked through the subreddit and it seems that ratings do have a huge impact but a 4 star review in a sea of 5’s seems to not be harmful imo!

136,Etsy," I have an issue with a buyer in US. It's an international order shipped from Singapore to US with normal mail tracking. The order has been shipped out on 21st Jan but the buyer only received it on 3rd March. The package has already reached US on 29th Jan but there was a delay in the sorting by USPS in the US. She was very unhappy and contacted me on that in 2nd week of Feb. I contacted the shipping company and they explained that due to bad weather in the beginning of the year and backlogs from the covid situation, there is a low manpower and they are trying to clear it as soon as possible. It was unfortunate that this package was delayed but the customer could not be more unreasonable. I have tried my best to follow up with the shipping company and it was really beyond my control. 

On 25th Feb, she suddenly claimed that she needed the dress for her son's birthday and demanded a compensation of $125. (50% of the custom dress cost) so she can use it to buy another dress for the event. She threatened to give a bad review and do a credit card chargeback on the order.

First of all, I was never communicated about this dress had to be delivered by 25th Feb. When she contacted me in mid December on a custom made dress, I specifically asked her when she needed it. I told her I was really busy in December and January due to all the festive seasons (Christmas, New Year and then upcoming chinese new year in mid Feb) and will not be able to take in any order that needs to be rushed and there will be a long leadtime for the incoming orders. My schedule was already packed. I also mentioned that if she needs it by a specific date, she has to let me know and it has to be shipped via expedited mail. 

She said she has no rush for it and will touch base in Jan. However, she placed the order on last day of Dec. Since with the assurance that it's not a rush order and there is no specific date needed, I went ahead with the order. After we finalized with the measurements, it was already the second week of Jan. I still prioritized her order to ship ahead of the schedule. It could have been shipped only in 1st-2nd week of Feb and it will still not be able to make it on 25th Feb without shipping delay. (as we all know, international normal shipping has been slow since the pandemic.)

Now that she has received the dress, she demanded the refund of $125 (50% of the dress cost) to ""turn this negative experience to a positive one"". I think it's clearly not fair for me. If she had told me that she needs it by 25th Feb, I definitely will not have accepted this order or either only allow expedited shipping for the order. She insisted that I was to be blamed for the shipping since she ordered in Dec and not received until March. But yet she said that she agreed with my production timeline mentioned to her before and was happy to give me all the time I need.

I don't think it's fair for me to get blamed for shipping as it's beyond my control and I have clearly communicated the leadtime before she placed the order. It's certainly not fair that I have to make a loss on the order after so much effort is done to make a custom dress if I have to compensate her $125 for the dress so she can use it to pay for another new dress. 

I also offered her another alternative. Since she no longer needs the dress for her event, I offered her a full refund if she ship back the dress and will reimburse her the shipping cost. She became unhappy and threatened to post the entire experience in a bad review in my Etsy shop. 

I asked her to ship back to me but she insisted that she will not step out of her house to post the package and I have to arrange a courier to pickup from her and send her the pre-paid label. i think she purposely wants to make it difficult as it's a lot harder for me to arrange a courier to pickup from her place since I don't stay in US. Even though I don't think I should pay for her return shipping, I just want to settle this instead of arguing further with her. 

I did eventually manage to contact DHL to pickup. Now, she demanded me to pay her for the envelope cost and refunded her first before she will hand over the package to DHL. I told her that I will only refund the order upon receipt of the dress.

She kicked up a big fuss and opened a case on Etsy against me. She complained about the delay in shipping is unacceptable. (ordered in end Dec but received on 3rd March) and said I hid behind covid and used pandemic as an excuse. But that's a fact. I have tried my best to file inquiries with USPS and shipping company on my side but that's the answer I have been given. 

In case she opened on Etsy, she threatened Etsy that she will contest the charges with her credit card company if nothing is done and threatened to blow this matter up on social media. But she has already received the dress and I even offered to do a return and refund her the order even though it's a custom dress. I don't think I should refund the order first before she shipped out the dress. She basically went crazy in the case she opened on Etsy and typed many essay-long messages, threatening Etsy and me. She insisted on the full refund before she will even send out the dress.

Will Etsy allow that? I don't want to deal with her anymore. She is really nasty in her messages.

I am still waiting for Etsy to reply in the case. i don't know what will happen. It's draining me out.Issue with a nasty buyer due to delivery delay"
137,Etsy,"I sent a message to a seller with a question about an item in their store about two days ago (3 hours shy of 48 hours). I'm going to wait to at least the full 48 hours, but then should I send a follow up message? Should I wait a few more days? What's the proper etiquette? I don't want to come across as pushy or aggressive, but I am also concerned that my message has somehow been missed over.Sent a message to a seller about two days ago, and haven't heard back yet.

138,Etsy,"I’m looking to buy multiple self-care, mainly bath/shower products, but I kind of don’t want to have to buy from 5 different shops having to pay for shipping 5 different times. 

I want to be able to choose from bath bombs, shower steamers, body scrubs, lip scrubs, bath salts, candles, etc. However, most of the shops I find will have just one or two. Like if I find a shop that has bath bombs, that shop typically only has bath bombs and maybe bath salts. If I find a body scrub, that shop doesn’t have bath bombs. 

I’m just wondering if there any shops where I can buy all the items from.Are there any shops that sell a range of self-care products?"
139,Etsy,"I’m in a difficult predicament and I’m not sure what to do. A buyer purchased an item from me last year. The items I sell are in the $200-$350 range. She received her item and disliked part of what she received (despite receiving detailed photos before shipment and approved of her item at the time). 

Then, she filed a complaint with Etsy and we went back and forth and to save myself a headache, I issued her a partial refund of about $70-$80. She was content with that. She then went and left a one star review. I blocked her as a buyer because she was particularly nasty in her language in addition to just being difficult to work with. 

I thought that was the end of that. However, she has now placed a second order with me. I blocked her previously, but she made another account and made another purchase. I know it is her because it is the same name and same shipping address.
I am wondering if I should go ahead with her order and hope this is a better experience, or just refund her and block her again to avoid a repeat experience.
Let me know what you think. Thanks!

Update: I refunded the buyer and canceled her order. I also sent an email to integrity@etsy.com and will reach out to Etsy support if I have further troubles with this buyer (and I probably will, honestly). Thanks for the help!


Update #2: I refunded and canceled her order and she later messaged me asking why I canceled, even though I already explained that I couldn’t make the order for her. I then got ANOTHER ORDER shortly after she messaged me, but it was for a different name and different address, but I am suspicious because the new shipping address is only about 30 mins away from the original. I suspect that this is the name and address of a friend or relative. Thoughts?Buyer who left bad review and received partial refund made another purchase"
140,Etsy,"Hi, I hope this is appropriate for this thread. I just purchased a piece of furniture from an Etsy shop that had thousands of reviews with photos (how I checked to make sure it’s not a scam... though second guessing myself now). Right after I purchased a coffee table from the shop I got an email from the shop owner that Etsy closed his store (for no apparent reason) and he still sending it, and I was promised a tracking number.... which I’m still waiting on. I don’t think I can open a customer service issue until the expected delivery date.... but my question is has this happened to anyone else? If so.... did you receive your item or got scammed out of $$? What should I do based on the above described situation? Note: I paid through Etsy and it linked me to PayPal to pay for this item... PayPal makes me pretty nervous.Bought something expensive and the shop shut down?"
141,Etsy,"I noticed all of my listings have been renewed way more than I thought. I realized that the amount of renewals is linked to each order (ex. 11 sales, 10 renewals, because someone ordered 2 units in one order).

Is there a way to turn this off or does etsy just always take that $0.20 out? And is that ON TOP of their other fees?Etsy always renews listings after every purchase?"
142,Etsy,"I have purchased from Etsy countless times and never ran into this issue, but I am not sure if this is normal or if I am possibly being scammed? I am no way blaming the seller but I just want some insight from others. I always leave reviews and not a difficult customer, I swear!

I purchased a wallet on 3/3 from a seller in Turkey. The shop only has 4 sales and 1 review which made me hesitate to purchase. However, I used a gift card for part and PayPal for the rest so I really wasn't too worried.  On 3/7 I received a message from the owner stating that shipping times have changed for the carrier and my package will now ship on 3/12 or 3/15 instead of 3/6. I said 'Okay. Thanks for letting me know.' He sent me another message on 3/10 stating my estimated delivery date is now 3/30-4/15, with links to an Etsy article on 'What is an estimated delivery date?'

I realize it's only the 17th but I have sent a few messages asking for any updates on shipping but feel I am being ghosted since there has been no reply in a few days. I would cancel the order if I could but the shop doesn't allow cancellations according to it's policies.

145,Etsy,"
This is going to be super long, just a heads up. Before I start, please refrain from judging. I recognize the decisions I made wrong and have definitely learned my lesson. I want to get this off my chest because I feel so angry. 

A couple of weeks ago, I received a message on Etsy from a buyer saying she was interested in one of my original canvas paintings. 16”x20” is the largest size I have for sale in my store, thus the highest priced item. So I was elated.

However, she said she was wondering if we could get around purchasing from Etsy and send a check instead. (Red flag #1)

As part of my shop policies, I only accept online payments. I responded to her by starting with thanking her for her interest in my art. And that in order to protect myself and my small business, I unfortunately could not accept a personal check as a payment. However (mistake #1) I could give her an exception where, if she would be willing, I’d need to have that check in my possession first, deposit and wait for the funds to clear, before I could send out the painting. That’s fair right?

She was excited and accepted. She said her uncle would be the one paying so she said to stand by while she talked with him. (I assumed it would be like a birthday gift or something from him).

Anyway there were a few back and forth emails between us and a rapport was built. She seemed genuine and I hate to say this but she wrote pretty well and to me, if I haven’t met them in person, the way a person writes speaks volumes about them. But who knew that scammers could write intelligently? How dare I stereotype huh. By this point she had already given me her home address to send the painting to (To me this was a sign that I could trust her, but still not enough to not type it into the USPS website just to make sure it was a legit address. And it was). Then she said her uncle had issued a cashiers check made out to me. I worked in banking for 3 years too so her saying it would actually be a cashiers check instead of a personal check made me feel a bit more comfortable because those are verified funds right off the bat. Though they could still be forged, as with everything else, they were at least somewhat a better option than a personal check. So it was sent to my PO Box, and we waited.

I get an email from her apologizing saying that there was a mistake made and the check coming to me was for more than the amount I charged for the painting. Apparently the check was for both her and her cousin and she didn’t realize it when she asked uncle to send it straight to me to avoid longer wait. She asked if once I received the check, to send her the extra funds so she could give it to her cousin. I said of course I would. 

I went to my P.O. Box every day for several days until it finally came. In those few days she kept asking if I’d gotten it, which I could understand feeling a bit anxious about it since it was a large amount of money (painting was for about $300, and the check I received was almost $1300), especially if a huge chunk of that is supposed to be for you. She was very polite about it, thanking me for understanding that this was a family matter and her cousin needed the money, obviously. By this point, I’d already gotten the painting all packaged and ready to go, so as soon as I deposited the check I’d send out her artwork, since we’d both been waiting for a couple weeks. 

I mobile deposited the check into my account, but it was placed on hold for a couple days, as is standard. I took the package and dropped it off at the post office, anyway (Mistake #2) with my thought process being that it was a cashiers check; it will clear. 

I sent her the tracking info and she was pretty excited. Then she asked me instead of turning around and writing a check to her cousin and mailing it out, if it would be better to send it to them via Zelle (Red flag #2). My bank already is connected with Zelle so I have an account. I was apprehensive, but agreed (Mistake #3)

So to remind you, this check had been placed on hold, and the funds wouldn’t release for two more days, so I DIDNT actually have her payment yet, but I got paid from my other job so I figured maybe I’d just send it now since they really needed it. (Why am I like this)

She gave me the person’s info. Name + email address, which are two of the minimum requirements for sending money via this platform. The name looked pretty fictitious to me (Red flag #3), as I’d never heard of such name, but I didn’t want to be that person who discriminates based on someone’s name. So I actually went on Facebook and Google and just did a quick search, and I was somewhat relieved to see that there were a handful people with that name. Guess I’d just never come across it before.

So I went and typed the name in the boxes, and then I wasn’t about to manually type in the email address, I never do. So I copied and pasted instead. You know when you type an email address on your email, it sends as a hyperlink (underlined and blue)? I right clicked and copied, and went onto Zelle and pasted it into the box. Well what pasted was a completely different email address (Red flag #4). Confused, I went back to the email she sent, and double checked the cousin’s email address. When I hovered over it, it showed the same address that pasted earlier, which was different from what she typed. I’m not an expert in deciphering illegitimate email addresses, but I assume there would be a way to use someone else’s email and somehow change the name of it to something else.

I sent the buyer a quick text (by this point we’d already exchanged numbers because we got in touch a lot), and asked her which email was correct. Of course, she said it was odd but the correct one should be what she typed. I shrugged and just manually typed it anyway (Mistake #4). 

Money was sent (BIG MISTAKE #5). She asked for a screenshot confirmation and thanked me a lot. 

All of this happened on Thursday. 

It’s Tuesday now, and this is where it gets interesting. 

I received an email notification from my bank this morning saying the held funds are now available. Sweet. I went on my banking app and noticed that the funds were NOT available, and instead the check amount was subtracted out with “Returned check” plus a $5 fee. So the email was conflicting. I notice all this before the bank opened so I couldn’t call them yet.

I hadn’t heard from the buyer yet since our last exchange Thursday, so I decided to go and check the tracking status of the painting since it should have gotten there Saturday. She’d told me she would send me a photo once she received it. Went on the USPS tracking. First it said “Out for delivery” on Saturday, then an hour later, “Return to sender request processed”, then “Intercepted, redirect as per sender request”. I didn’t request anything to be redirected? Why couldn’t it be delivered? Where is the package? Who intercepted it? 

I sent an email to the buyer, “Good morning, do you see this tracking?” To my surprise, she responded with a text right away (it was like 0430 EST) and said she would look. With a “how are you today?”. At this point my gut instincts were freaking out and this time I didn’t suppress it, which is what I should’ve done from the start. I ignored her question and waited until she saw the tracking status. Of course, she responded with “hmm, it appears to me that you intercepted it and redirected back to you?” To which I replied “I did not intercept anything and I wouldn’t have even known about this had I not checked the tracking status on my own”. And she goes on to say I’m so sorry let me get a hold of my uncle and I’m sure we’ll figure out “reimbursement for you.”

Hmm, how odd because I hadn’t even mentioned about the check being returned, and she was already going on her autopilot script about reimbursement. I bluntly asked her how she knew about the money when I hadn’t told her about it? All I got were excuses.

Anyways, she kept telling me she’ll figure this out and get it taken care of, and she’ll stay in touch.

(Im going to tell you at this point that her name is ELIZABETH SANDERS, just so y’all can be alert and be on the lookout for her name, especially if you’re an Etsy seller.)

Few hours later, I was able to get in touch with the bank and asked about the returned check. Surprise, surprise, check was returned due to it being altered and fictitious. Again, I worked in banking so I’d know quickly if a check looked odd. This check, I’m telling you, my husband and I examined it this morning and it’s as legit as it could look. It even has a security hologram, watermark, and everything else. I’m glad the bank caught it. I quickly told them about my situation, and thankfully, they got right on top of it. They also filed a dispute for the already-sent Zelle payment, to see if we could get that back. They said a fraud crime has been reported, and that this person would not be able to scam other people anymore. Meaning they’d be arrested. 

After I hung up with the bank, I then called the USPS in PA that processed the return to sender request, and I asked about the interception (my worry was that these scumbags still wanted to steal my painting on top of the money) but thankfully, the post office was the one who intercepted the delivery. GET THIS. The address I sent the painting to is an Amish farm, for one, and no Sanders lives there. Two, they said this Elizabeth Sanders has been flagged by their post office because this month alone, 10-15 packages had been sent to this address, and the poor farmers were getting bombarded by random packages they didn’t know what to do with. I feel bad for all the other sellers who they’ve victimized. I hope they got their items and money back as well. But that no one else would fall for this person’s crap moving forward.

I’m taking a deep breath right now. So. My dearly loved painting is coming back to me. My life’s work. Thank GOD. 

Guess that’s what I get for being so kind hearted and flattered thinking someone wanted my art enough to go through this entire ordeal, when in reality they could really care less about the painting and just wanted the money. One of my worst fears for being an artist is my work being stolen online and sold by others without my knowledge, but I never imagined being flat out scammed. How did I miss this?? As I said, all the red flags were there from the start, I just didn’t listen to my gut. UGH.

**

The last exchange we had through text went like this: (and this was after I’d verified the fraud with the bank)

ELIZABETH: I’ll have to check with my uncle and let you know what I find out. I’m sure we’ll figure it out. I’ll be in touch

ME: It’s obvious at this point that this is a fraudulent activity so I’m not sure what else we’d be figuring out. You know what I mean?

ELIZABETH: Excuse me? I’m not sure I understand. I will never put you in a situation as terrible as that. Would you have me handle this and we’ll be done please.

Deep inside I wanted to believe her, to give her the benefit of the doubt, that somehow she wasn’t involved and that it was the uncle who had tricked all of us. That was until the USPS corroborated everything. 

Im not sure how the authorities would go about apprehending these people considering they used a random address, but I’m hoping for the best. 

At the end of the day, I’m getting my painting back unscratched, my money back, these people hopefully arrested, and most importantly me learning my lesson.

She messaged me Tuesday to ask when I would dispatch them, even tho I had dispatched them the previous day, I responded as soon I saw it letting her know she should have had an email
Letting her know they were dispatched. Thursday she messaged me to ask when they would arrive, I missed this, it was my partners 30th so I was making a lockdown birthday special. Friday she messages again the same message, I apologise and let her know I'll contact the courier and why I was rubbish at replying. I didn't realise she had opened a case. Courier didn't reply over the weekend- wasn't expecting them to. Sunday night I message her letting her know and that's when I notice the case. 

Monday I get up and rush making these shelves again, pay £16 for next day delivery with parcelforce. Making shelves is hard work but i did it whilst my 6 month old kicked off! They were picked up, let the customer know. 

They didn't deliver them...

All hell breaks loose, she kicks off calls me a liar, says I make excuses, I've ignored her for days... Etsy closes the case in her favour. She gets a refund. She replies to my message kicking off some more saying if the shelves aren't delivered tomorrow she wants a full refund even tho she already has one. Honestly she was horrible. I had a little cry- I know sad! But I worked so hard and sacrificed time with my little one to make her happy and she accused me of all sorts and left me a scathing untrue review!

I am confused because there are a lot of numbers per transaction/ order so I wanted to ask people who are actually doing it. 

So say someone purchases something from my shop and paid the taxes based on their province. So the total they paid is 'X'. Now when Etsy gives me money they give 'Y', they deduct some fees and tax from it. On top of which they deduct transaction fees off the same order which is a separate entry on the CSV and for an order I get an intotal of 'Z'.

When I calculate GST to give do I calculate it of 'X' , 'Y' or 'Z'. I thought I have to calculate of 'Y' or 'Z' because that is what I have received for the order.

164,Etsy,"Hey all,
Just wondering how everyone is logging their orders for tax season? I’m considering doing a simple spreadsheet for the following:
Customer name / customer’s state / product / sold cost / Etsy’s commission cost / item cost to produce / item price to ship / final profit margin. I will keep another spreadsheet for purchasing of materials such as shipping bags, mailers, bubble wrap ect.... just wondering if anyone does there’s outside of quick books or an app?How is everyone logging their orders / spending on inventory / supplies"
165,Etsy,"I went to ship an order out today, and when I went to print the label I noticed it had an invalid address and it would not allow me to purchase a shipping label. The order was supposed to ship out today, I reached out to the buyer but have not heard back. I want to change the ship by date so that Etsy doesn't think I'm late on sending the package, if I change it to tomorrow and still don't hear from the buyer, will I be able to change it to farther out? Thank you in advance!Can I update the Ship by Date more than once?"
166,Etsy,"Am I missing some well known psychology marketing thing?

Please explain me **why mostly my clients buy a single item on its full price, rather than buying 2 (with 30% discount) or 3 with (40% discount)** or 2 with 20% and 3 with 40% etc. I am overstocked and I want to get rid off some items and clients still order by one item only. 

Also I just feel it\`s not fair for them to pay so much for a single item + tax in some countries + delivery... Usually I try to have a higher price for an item, so my returning customers can always have 30% discount on any product too + for me to make some random sales. 

What\`s your experience with such discounts? What has better results when you want to sell more than 1 item?

167,Etsy,"I design cool 3D printed gadgets and last night I listed my latest creation a plastic butterfly knife trainer. It already sold two before I went to bed so I knew it was going to be popular and I was really excited! Then today I wake up with an email from Etsy saying it violates their terms of service since its a weapon/knife.

I completely understand that selling weapons isn't allowed. My question is if I relist it without the word knife would that be okay? Or are even fake weapons not allowed? A few other people sell basically the exact same thing so I didn't think it was an issue. 

I read that Etsy is a three strikes and you are out place so I don't want to risk getting banned permanently...My plastic toy butterfly knife got taken down for being a weapon... Best way to proceed?"

169,Etsy,"I sell sewn objects that are ready-made (IE I only list items that are made and ready to ship). I make a few items in several different fabric options. Right now when I get an order I fold these objects, wrap them in all together a piece of tissue paper, tie them up, put on my branding, etc, and ship them all in kraft bubble mailers. Very simple and semi eco-friendly packaging. 

I have been considering for a long time to place each item in a plastic cello self seal sleeve. There are several reasons why. Not only would it protect these items in storage, and help me organize everything, but it would further protect them if the package is damaged, and its something that would really be beneficial for in person sales events. The thought is that I would have a designated sample unwrapped to be handled by a potential buyer, and all of the items themselves would be nicely folded and laid out in baskets in these clear cello sleeves for a buyer to pick out their desired fabric. That way, these items are not being handled so much in person (only to be sold online later), would be easier to sort through, I could put the price directly on the cello sleeve with a small sticker, etc.

My concern is that, from my perspective, most buyers on Etsy are relatively eco-conscious, myself included, and if I ordered several items from a shop and received everything individually wrapped, I would raise an eyebrow not only because of the sheer amount of plastic, but also because it makes the items seem ""less-handmade"" so to say. That much plastic is something you expect from Amazon, not from a handmade seller on Etsy

An alternative I have considered are glassine bags, but patterns are much more difficult to see through them, which removes most of their benefit for in person sales events, and would make packaging items much more difficult for me as it would be harder to quickly find the item I am looking for.

So - is this something that I should do? Any alternatives?As a buyer - How do you feel about plastic packaging/Items being individually wrapped?"

182,Etsy,"Hi!

I've been loving selling on Etsy and my brand is home decor items with really cute graphic design illustrations depicting designer purses. These are all illustrations and many brands do this. I know NOT to list an item as ""Chanel lover coffee mug,"" etc, rather, ""Designer inspired Mug"".

&amp;#x200B;

There are dozens and dozens of stores that have been around on Etsy for years and years some with 10,000 + sales, others with 100,000 + doing the same thing I am.

&amp;#x200B;

I just received a few of my popular listings delisted because of copyright and I do not have Chanel anywhere on the listing or even on the product itself. It's just an illustration. I'm wondering if I'm being flagged because perhaps in my tags I have ""Chanel"". ? 

&amp;#x200B;

I have done hours and hours and hours of research about this over the last year and know the importance of saying ""designer inspired"". These art works fall into the category of Pop Art.

186,Etsy,"Am in the U.K. for context. 

I ordered a personalised “my 1st Mother’s Day” onesie for my son 11 days before Mother’s Day via an Etsy seller, giving it plenty of time to arrive. A week after I ordered it (Thurs last week) it still hadn’t been dispatched so I contacted the seller and asked if it was going to be dispatched soon as obviously I wanted it for Mother’s Day on the Sunday. I know the post is a bit iffy on the U.K. at the moment so was surprised he’d left it that late to post. I got a curt response back saying they were very busy and that it’ll be dispatched tomorrow (Fri) on 24hr delivery. 

On Fri, the delivery got updated to say it had been dispatched via Hermes but no tracking number. 

Saturday afternoon, I contacted the shop again saying that it hadn’t turned up so could I have the tracking number to see where it is? I got an auto reply saying they were away all weekend but all Mother’s Day products had been dispatched. 

Mother’s Day came and went and no product. On Monday, I messaged again and asked for a refund. There’s no point having it now as the event has passed. 

This morning, I got another generic response saying that the seller’s father had died unexpectedly and so he wouldn’t be in the office for a while. Someone else would be fulfilling outstanding orders and all Mother’s Day goods had been dispatched. There was no reference to any of my messages. 

So what do I do? I don’t want to be insensitive if his father has just died. However, ultimately I’ve paid for goods I haven’t received and I have no way of checking it even got dispatched. Any advice would be most welcome. 

Side note - just to further complicate things, we recently moved house and the order auto-filled my old address. I did message to give my new address straight away and the seller said he would send it there. The people at our old house haven’t received it either and are keeping a look out for it. It’s another reason I want the tracking number - I want to see where it’s been sent!Advice needed re missing goods"

I reached out to the Seller regarding how long it usually takes an item to arrived in the U.S. The Seller said I should receive it within 29 days from when it was shipped. That would've been February 29th. When that didn't happen, I messaged the Seller again who said it should arrived by March 6th. That didn't happen either.

Finally, I asked the Seller to contact Russian Post to see if they could find out anything further. They responded that they did, and that the item was in the U.S. and is being transported. It is now coming up on 2 months and the item has not been received, and I have no U.S. tracking information.

208,Etsy,"So, she doesn't have an Etsy shop (I think), but basically what happened was that about 2 weeks ago I received an Instagram message from another small business asking if I wanted to do a product swap, I followed her on Tiktok and actually liked the products (jewelry) ,  so I agreed. My business is selling printables, so I explained that I don't have physical copies and she seemingly didn't want it anymore, but suddenly she sends me one of my posts (of my most expensive product, custom illustration portraits) and asks like ""omg you make these?"" But she already knew, the first message she sent me was reacting to my story about said illustrations.

Anyway, we agreed that I would make her an illustration and send her a digital planner in exchange for a necklace from her shop (I knew it was unfair bus she said she would share everything I sent her and she had a decent following compared to my 130 IG followers). So, when it came time to pick what I wanted suddenly most of the products were sold out or unavailable, we agreed on a beaded necklace and she actually sent me videos of her making it and everything. And she said she would send it on Monday (it was Sunday).  By Tuesday, I think, I had her illustration and sent it to her (stupid me, I know), she shared it on her personal IG, not her store's, which I thought was weird but she had 5000 followers so I didn't mind.

She thanked me and said my necklace would be sent on Wednesday (so...not Monday?).  Meanwhile she started posting tiktoks and IG stories with the necklace on her and announcing a new collection and I just thought ""I hope that's not the same necklace, we're in a pandemic...""

Anyway, on the same day she posted a story saying that she had personal problems and that Wednesday orders would go out on monday...so by now there's a week delay...but then on Wednesday she posts another story, in line at the post office!!

I really wanted to believe everything was fine because I want to support other small businesses and I know how hard it is to manage your personal life and business sometimes...

Since then she has done a lot of tiktoks packing orders and stories about products and other stores receiving her products. So I just brushed it of and thought why would she send it to other people and not me! Meanwhile she has not posted my products anywhere else or done the tiktoks she promised with them.

So...this past tuesday I messaged her asking if she had already sent it because I was genuinely concerned that the post office had lost it or something like that. And she told me she has a lot of classes and that she would send it on the next day (Wednesday) or Thursday and that she would tell me when she sent it. Well, it is Sunday and nothing, even tough she keeps posting videos packaging orders...

Should I just ignore it and never do a product swap again? I don't really want the necklace that bad (or at all at this point)...I just wanted to connect with other small business so that we could support each other...

What do I do?

I think sometimes people think that because they are digital products they are not ""valuable"" but the illustration took me about 2 full days to make and with the planner, I ended up sending her about $17 of products....

EDIT: I also just remembered that the week I sent her my products she did a bunch of stories on her store's IG showing products she had received that week from other businesses...and nothing about me...and I ignored that because she had said that she was going to print the illustration and I thought that maybe she hadn't had time to do so...

213,Etsy,"Hi everyone, so last year I started selling on etsy and around June and July the niche I was in really started exploding and I was selling tons of stuff. At my peak I probably had over 100 orders in one month. It definitely tapered off due to various reasons (the niche I was in becoming less relevant but not completely irrelevant) but I was still selling maybe 10-20 orders a month by the time November came around. I was worried about getting things out in time for Christmas so I went into vacation mode in early December, then turned vacation mode off right after Christmas and sales did pick up ok in Jan and Feb. But I've only had one single sale since the beginning of March. I know a lot of that is due to the fact that a lot of my products have become less relevant but I'm also wondering if the algorithm has decided to stop showing my shop all together and if I should be worried. If I start listing some new items that are more relevant to today, should I expect the algorithm to pick those up again or should I just accept my losses and start a whole new account? Has anyone managed to steer their shop back into good sales after a period of very little?

Note that I have had mostly positive reviews (and all 5 star reviews since December at least) so it doesn't seem like that's dinging my account.

Thanks for any advice or experiences that anyone would like to share with me.Can shops die? Did my shop die? Can it get a second chance?"

215,Etsy,"I'm working with a customer who is REALLY slow to respond to messages about her custom order, so her order is four days overdue. It's worrying me that Etsy might penalize me somehow for having that order floating around even though it's because the customer takes several days to respond to messages. Is that a potential issue? I have about forty other orders I'm in the process of fulfilling and only one overdue (this is probably my fourth in total over the past few months; two were only overdue by like an hour or two, another by a couple of days because of a processing time issue), and hopefully they can see that I've gone back and forth with the customer and am currently waiting for her to approve my design?

Ok brand new seller here. Read through some posts in this sub looking as to why my listing was inactivated. Found that I used #momlife in my tag and title, and although my product said nothing similar, I used that tag knowing it was a popular tag but my dumbass didn't look up the copyright.

I sell pendant jewelry that comes in multiple styles and colors, and offer several kinds of fancy variations. I’d like to create a “build your own piece” kind of system, but since Etsy limits listings to only two variations, I’m wondering:

If I were to offer only the base pendant as a standard listing, and listed options such as necklace type and embellishments as add-ons, would that make it too complicated for buyers to navigate/too complicated for me as the seller to maintain?

I googled Hysan LLC and it has HORRIBLE reviews. Now I’m confused about who this seller is.


I read that Hysan LLC is connected with brushing scams. They basically create fake transactions so they can leave 5-star reviews on their own profile. Then they send customers worthless products.

I had a customer order something, which was shipped within my processing time. After some time they contacted me to ask where the package was because they hadn't received it. I said I would look into it and get back to her asap. 

The tracking wasn't showing any update information, I looked into it and the shipping company said they couldn't locate it. Sucks, but these things happen especially these days. 

I sent out a second package and after it had already sent, the customer said they didn't want it anymore. 

I told her I couldn't refund her since the second package was in transit and she started going off how unprofessional it was for me to send out another order, she didn't believe the package was lost, I must be lying or just forgot to send it because she had received other packages from other places no problem. 

She started making all sorts of accusations about me and my business and how dare I blame the pandemic. She said she if I didn't refund her immediately etsy would force me to. 

She's now opened a case saying I'm refusing to refund her and Etsy should stop me selling on the platform! 

I've already lost money on the order, by having to send a second package, I really don't want to refund this person who will get their money back and the items and I will be out three times on it.

i contacted the seller the day the candy arrived on the 16th of february and she was extremely sweet and helpful, she was very apologetic about her mistake and told me she shipped out a replacement package with the correct order the following day with some extra goodies to compensate. 

when she was mentioning this, she did not give me a tracking # of the correct order she was shipping out, but i figured she probably just forgot and it would arrive soon enough because she shipped it so quick! 

now it’s almost a month later and the package she claims to have sent out with the correct order still hasn’t arrived? i don’t know what to think. even in the worst of USPS times during december of 2020 it never took this long to receive a package...

she’s in florida and i’m in massachusetts so it’s not even traveling that long of a distance. 

many of her recent reviews are not great as well —  many complaining of long shipping times and incorrect orders……😳 

yesterday i messaged her and said that i hoped she was doing well, and that it was okay if the package potentially hadn’t been scanned yet, but that i would like a tracking #. 

she has yet to reply and it’s been a whole day so i am kind of not expecting a response. 

in the case that she doesn’t respond do you think i should file a dispute on etsy and will my images of the candy i received, packaging and messages be enough to cover me? i feel terrible that i have to do this but i also can’t afford to have spent that much on candy and only receive half of what i paid for. i also paid with paypal as opposed to card - will the $ go back on my paypal?Unfortunate situation with seller :("

I always post my orders out the same day so it gets there the next day most of the time. But the customer messaged me yesterday asking for a tracking number so she could see just how far the item had reached. 

I gave it to her and checked the tracking myself only to find that it is sitting in a post office after the postman was unable to delivery it (no one answered the doorbell). It was been two days. 

Customer was amazing!! She called the building that the gift was supposed to be delivered at. They said they hadn't seen it. I was getting worried because 1. It's a gift. 2. I don't want to mess up my new etsy experience. Then she gave me the phone number and I called the building. Nothing. Because the postman did not drop a ""something for you"" card. Customer then drove for 20 minutes to a post office to find out more info. Delivery was rearranged for today and yay, it's been delivered. 

I apologised to the customer because her surprise for a child's birthday was ruined. She said I had nothing to apologise for. I'm just proud of the way she handled things and the way I did too. It wasn't her fault and it wasn't mine. It was Royal Mail :/ 

I just wanted to add that I have ordered from etsy and always make sure I leave a feedback etc. Sweet customers truly do make a difference. So if you ever have an issue with a buyer, please give them a chance to rectify and vice versa!

257,Etsy,"For those of you who have yet to see, Etsy appears to have changed it’s viewing format on at least the mobile website.

I have yet to see if this is the same on desktop.

In my personal opinion, I’m not a fan of the change. Perhaps it will take a while for it to grow on me, but I just find the gaps in the portraits ugly and distracting. It makes seeing all the thumbnails more difficult.

It reminds me of when someone is trying to fit a paragraph of text alongside an image in their PowerPoint, so they squish it to the side to make it fit.

In general, it just seems like such a waste of space to force all of the images into a weird portrait mode like this.

Again, I haven’t checked what it’s like on desktop.

I don’t mind if Etsy decides to go in this peculiar design direction, but I do hope they change how it looks on mobile.

I love Etsy and this format definitely would **not** cause me to abandon the site. It’s just a personal preference of mine.

259,Etsy,"I just want to motivate you guys a little bit! I see so many stories about Karens and awful buyers, that I want to share a positive one with you that happened recently :) 

tl;dr: 

I sent a small item to a buyer, it never arrived. After 3 months I sent off a new one which resulted in about -11€ loss for me. A few days after I sent the item off, the buyer contacted me saying, that the first one did arrive. They then offered to pay in full for the additional one. I was very happy about that and proposed that I would omit shipping for them, so that I would be able to just cover my losses without making any profit from the sale(s) and save they buyer about 10€. Every party was happy with that :)

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

&amp;#x200B;

So I sell small animal plant pot hangers ( Pretty much animals that you can decorate your plant pots with). Their sales price and thus my margin is not very high. (About 10 € per piece with  4 € material cost, not factoring in labor time)

A while ago in mid-December I got an order for one of them, so I sent the product on its way with tracked shipping. All was well until about 2 weeks ago, when the buyer contacted me about never receiving her order. She wasn't in any way rude, she just inquired about where it might be. Sure enough, I check the shipping and it went from Germany to Overseas fine, but in the destination country it had been stuck in ""Pre-Transit"" since Dec 20th (So over 3 months!). The buyer and I considered the package lost and since its the sellers responsibility, I sent off another one with tracked shipping for which I paid 17€ out of pocket (Materials + shipping, not considering labor time). So now, with my extremely small margin, I sat at about -11€ loss from this sale alone. 

&amp;#x200B;

Then, just a few days ago I get another message from the buyer "" I just received the first package. Thank you for sending the other one anyways! As soon as it arrives, I will pay for the second one!""

&amp;#x200B;

I was so astounded, since most buyers wouldve probably never contacted me about the first package, let alone offer to pay for the second one! Since it is and was my responsibility as a seller to get the product to them and I thought their offer was so generous, I told them that I would omit the shipping fee, so that what they pay for the second one covers my losses, but I won't make any profit from it. They and I are both happy with this arrangement and now we're just waiting for the second product to make it to them!

&amp;#x200B;

I also contacted postal services about the absurd shipping time/loss of the item but of course they never got back to me :) Despite me purchasing insurance for said shipment.

&amp;#x200B;

With excessive delays in international shipments, when would be a good time to ask for a refund? The seller said his last package took 102 days so I am thinking until then, and after I will ask for a refund, does everyone agree? Has anyone's international packages taken longer? 

The seller put a lot of time and quality effort into this product and I have been patient. I have not gotten an update since it was released from Russian post on 12/13/20. 

Thank you and God Bless everyone!

261,Etsy,"Is there anything I can do about this? I sell digital smart displays, and had a return due to some damage. I sent them a return label via Etsy (about $30 cost) and told them to use the original packaging.

Is there anything I can do about this now or tips to avoid it in the future?

262,Etsy,"Hi everyone. I placed an order for a plant on Feb 13. The seller had a note that said she would take a couple weeks to ship, but that was fine because it was super cold. I started paying attention around March 1. A shipping label was generated, so I expected my plant to arrive soon. Nope. Never actually was put in the mail. Now the seller has 'temporarily' stopped all sales and is 'taking a break.' I've tried messaging only to be met with automated responses. I went through the Etsy 'help with an order' process and requested a refund, but because a shipping label had been generated, I had to wait until yesterday to be able to open a case. Miraculously, yesterday, the shop owner replied with an apology and said she would ship today (yesterday). New shipping label generated. However, it's still marked as pre-transit. While I've been waiting, the shop's reviews have taken a nosedive with multiple customers describing this exact same experience. I'm doubtful I'm going to get my plant, but I can't open a case because of the shipping label thing. How do I get my money back?

&amp;#x200B;

264,Etsy,"Hey guys!

So I’m trying to find the best mockups for prints to put in our Etsy shop. Placeit has a lot of great mockups for wall art that I’ve found, and it’s been recommended over and over and over again in videos and blog posts that I’ve researched. 

But last night, my partner and I uploaded some mockups into the spot where you put your product pictures, and it gave us the warning “pictures look best when they’re 2000px on their shortest side”, meaning our mockups weren’t big enough. Literally none of the mockups we found seem to be that big to start with.

So what gives? People recommend this site ALL THE TIME. And yet their mockups are all too small for Etsy.

We fudged our first listing by just putting them in Canva and making them be 2000px by 2000px by dragging the mockup bigger, but that diminishes the quality and is just another added step that feels tedious. And a lot of the features of the mockup get lost when we expand them in our 2000px by 2000px template, like a bed will get cut out or most of the set will get cut out.

How do you all Placeit users get around this? We can’t afford and don’t have the skills for Photoshop. Are there any other freemium sites that actually HAVE Etsy-size-approved mockups without having to make them bigger in Canva before posting them?  What would you all recommend?Placeit Mockup images too small for Etsy product pictures"

I opened up an Etsy store roughly two months ago, but I didn't publish any listings because I was still in the process of taking product photos. So, my store was completely empty and had no sales. I recently logged into my Etsy account a week ago, and I noticed that my account had been suspended, but I received no email as to why. I sent the following support request:

""Hi! I created an Etsy account over a month ago in hopes of starting a store, but I didn't put any products into my store then. I just logged into my account today and it said that my account was suspended. However, when I went into my emails to search for the Etsy email explaining why my account was closed, I couldn't find it. I'm hoping you can clarify why my account was closed and what I need to do to reopen it. Thank you!""

Several days later, I received the following email:

""Hello,

This is Etsy's Trust &amp; Safety team.

Your account has been identified as high-risk based on a close review of your account information. For this reason, Etsy has elected to revoke your buying and selling privileges permanently. Etsy reserves the right to close any other accounts you may own as well.

Regardless of your account status, you remain obligated to fulfill any open orders by shipping the items or issuing a full refund.

Please do not open any other accounts on Etsy. They will be closed immediately and without notice.

This decision is final, and we will be unable to respond to any further outreach about your account. This email constitutes our final communication on this matter.

Thank you for your attention to this.

Regards,Etsy Trust and Safety""

I sent a follow-up email inquiring about this suspension to Etsy Trust and Safety (even though they said that decisions were final), and I also sent another support request following this email because I was incredibly confused as to why I was permanently suspended. Etsy never explained why I was suspended in the first place, and I've never bought or sold on Etsy before. It's been three days since my last support request, and I'm concerned that I'll never get an answer as to why this happened. I called Etsy support today and they basically told me that they can't do anything to help me and that my best bet is to email Etsy Trust and Safety, which I already did three days ago. Does anyone have advice because I'm at a loss for what I'm supposed to do?

278,Etsy,"Hey everyone!

I’ve been in business for about two years now. We have been profitable, but not enough to fully rely on the income. We have many sales channels, Etsy being one of them.

On Etsy today, I got a message from my competitors team member saying that my design is against their copywrite and licensing.

I had asked to see the details on their copywrite because my design is a lot different.

To explain this:
Their design is a fingerprint that includes books in the Bible to form the fingerprint. They are hand made, in cursive and are posters (wall art)

My design is a thumbprint that includes EVERY book in the Bible to form a thumbprint. My design has a very distinctive font, design and wording that is totally apart from their design. I also sell my design on shirts (apparel).

With this being said, I understand that the designs sound very similar, but visually the designs are obviously different.

My designer used a custom font and formation for my thumbprint. They obviously have a different designer and a custom font for their fingerprint.

With all this being said, what should I do about this? If I don’t see their copywrite details, how can I be sure any of this is against their terms? I can’t simply just take my competitors word for it and remove my product. 

Any suggestions will be greatly appreciated!Competitor claims my design is against their copywrite."

I've spent months doing trial and error to make one that stands out, informative(cause nobody read description anymore), multipurpose, yet looks stylish and gorgeous.

While checking for trends, I've found a new shop with a similar market that copied my style(font, font size, layout, color), similar enough that people will think it was made by me. I know that it wasn't copyrighted, but it kinda pisses me off and I'm afraid that it might fool the customer

286,Etsy,"Prior to ordering, this seller was very responsive and answered any questions I had about the product I wanted (which was a $1k made-to-order costume that would be ready to ship in 2-3 weeks). After a few weeks of exchanging messages, I told her I would like to order and she assured me that as soon as I purchased, she would start making it right away. Feeling excited and confident from the good reviews, I finally placed the order on 2/15 along with my measurements and custom requests. 

Three days later, I realized there was one more customization that I wanted for the costume, so I messaged her about it. After no immediate response, and fearing that she might've already started working on it, I contacted her on Instagram and apologized for the double message, letting her know that I wanted to message her about my request before it was too late. She replied back saying it was okay and not to worry.

Over a week later, 2/28: I message her on Etsy kindly asking for an update on my order progress. No response.

Week later 3/06: I send her an email kindly asking again for an update on my order, acknowledging she must be busy and that I'm in no rush to receive the order, but that I just wanted to know the status. She messages me back on Instagram apologizing, saying she'll answer me soon and that she doesn't always receive notifs from Etsy. I say no worries, I'll wait. She sees the message but no more response.

3/08: My order was scheduled to dispatch by this day so I message her on Insta, telling her that I know I said I'd wait, but since my order was supposed to ship today, I thought I'd ask her about it. She replies and apologizes again, saying she's been working a lot. She says my order is in progress and sends me a pic, and that she'll send me more photos in a few days. She says she plans on shipping it next week. So basically, she never started on my order right away like she said she would. Regardless, I say no worries, I'm glad to know.  After a few exchanges I ask if tracking is provided. She sees my message but no response, although she continues to post stories promoting new suits she's making and asking ppl to message her if they want to order.

3/10: I become worried that she might misread one of the measurements I gave her (regarding shoe size b/c she is in a different country) so I message her clarifying the measurement, apologizing if I seemed like an annoying customer and thanked her for her patience. Again, she sees the message but no response, yet continues to post multiple stories promoting other new costumes she is making and asking ppl to message her if they want to order.

I definitely don't want to send another message and become that truly mega ""annoying customer"" for sure, so at this point I decided I would just wait and hope she'll ship my items next week as promised so that I won't worry anymore. 

However, it is concerning to me that ever since I made the purchase, her communication has been very inconsistent. I understand things coming up and getting busy, but it kinda rubs me the wrong way that she had the time to post frequently on social media but not take the time to just send back a simple reply. It also bothers me that she didn't tell me my order would be late until I had to ask her myself. I wonder if she still would've reached out had I not messaged her. Am I getting scammed or am I overreacting? This is the first time I've ever had concerns about an Etsy seller even though this person has high ratings. I don't know what to do and I hope I'm just being paranoidLack of communication from 5-star seller"

A day before it was to ship the seller messaged me and said the person she buys supplies from had just shipped the materials and it wouldn't arrive until 2-25-3-1. 
I didn't even catch this until yesterday, I was told she had these things on hand originally. I was taking screen shots just in case and caught it. Ugh.
I asked for an update on 3-4 and she told me the beginning of next week. I messaged her yesterday and she told me tomorrow for sure.
I messaged her today and she told me life has just been really hectic and work has been crazy for her ""she'll get it to me when she can."" She keeps saying things like ""I'm sorry I'm the worst, I've never had an order be so late."" Etc. I know life happens seriously, I get it. My job is so hectic and tedious too...I get it. 

I'm not sure what to even do. I hate to open a case because if she made my item I know she spent alot of time on it but at the same time, I can't even use it for long. That is nobody's fault but I figured it would have been here March 1 at the latest. It was a bunny mobile for my daughters crib...her nickname is bunbun and it was such a sweet mobile. She's going to be crawling soon and I'm sure she'll slap it around when she does, as babies do. I should have probably just not gotten a mobile because I knew I was very late but I was so excited and happy that we had her nursery done after over a year of an entire gut and remodel. 
Do I open a case?When do I open a case for a refund? When is enough enough?"

312,Etsy,"Hello!
Any tips for calculating shipping costs for live plants? I’m relatively new to Etsy, last summer I sold some plants but just did free shipping and tried to make sure the price of the item covered the cost of shipping. But I’m hoping to find a way to calculate the cost to ship so I can be as accurate as possible. But with plants growing throughout the season it’s hard to know what they will weigh and what size box I’ll need by the time they ship. 
Thanks in advance!Calculating shipping for plants"

314,Etsy,"  

Maybe something like this already exists…or is it too stupid... so, I’m asking first.

I would like to create a community “**Etsy shop first impressions**,” but I am not allowed yet – I’m still a *baby Reddit.* 

It would be for everyone that would like to know what people think when they first see their Etsy shop - products, prices, titles, shop appearance, name, icon, banner, pictures, reviews… whatever comes to their mind. That kind of (short or long) feedback would be especially appreciated from the fellow sellers.

The rules: Everyone that would like to GET the first impression feedback for their store is obligated to GIVE at least two first impressions about two other Etsy shops.

How does this sound? Would anyone like to create a community like this?Etsy shop first impressions"

317,Etsy,"Hey all!

I'm looking for some help. I set up my shop a little less than a month ago, and when I tried to log in yesterday, I was locked out and simply greeted with a banner over the login box that said ""This account has been deactivated."" I checked my email (INCLUDING my spam folder!!), and had not received any kind of communication from Etsy warning me about my shop being deactivated. I sent an email right away, and called customer service. From looking through previous posts on this sub, it looks like I got the same spiel they always give (""This happens to new shops, but another team actually reviews these cases, so you'll have to talk to them about why you were deactivated when they email you, etc.""). I'm just sitting her absolutely puzzled as to why I got deactivated, as I don't seem to meet any of the criteria I've seen cited by etsy or on forums for deactivation. 

\-I make resin jewelry, accessories, and small homegoods (trinket boxes/trays, makeup organizers, things like that), so nothing that could possibly be copywritten (I didn't have any with any images encapsulated-just pigments and dried flowers). 

\-As my shop is all physical items that are made by me, I don't use any production partner. 

\-I believe my shop was ONLY set up with Etsy pay, as I hadn't connected a PayPal account, and my first two deposits had gone to my bank successfully (and both cycles my incoming profits have covered my fees for the week, so they haven't had to withdraw anything from my account). 

\-I have shipped all of my orders from the zip code that I have entered for my account, and every order has shipped in a timely manner (usually even same or next day when I quote 1-3 business days). 

\-I don't use a VPN on any of my devices, and nobody else who uses any of the wifi networks that I've accessed my shop account on have an Etsy shop-just me, so I don't think it's flagging the system for multiple shops.

Looking through previous posts here and on other forums, every other reason I've seen for accounts being shut down with no warning have been debunked in one way or another. Any help is greatly appreciated!!

318,Etsy,I opened my first case against a seller on March 3rd and escalated it on March 6th since we both agreed to let Etsy decide. I haven’t received anything saying that anyone has viewed my case.

319,Etsy,"I’ve seen a lot of posts about how poor March has been for traffic and sales, so with that in mind:

I’ve started posting on relevant subreddits (recommendations welcome for others) and 9GAG, tons more success in terms of interest on 9GAG.

320,Etsy,"This was super unexpected and random for me, because my shop is only a few months old and most of my sales are from friends &amp; family, but I got a message after an order saying that the customer's daughter will be wearing my earrings in her wedding!! 

When I sent her the earrings, I included a pair of studs that matched the pair she ordered for free because I was so moved and honored and she messaged me last night after they arrived to say thank you and let me know her daughter also wants her bridesmaid to have a pair of my earrings for the wedding and ordered *again!* I was so shocked!!

This is my first \*real\* business and I'm all torn up about it! She said she's going to send me pictures from the wedding and I'm so excited. :) I had to tell someone who would understand how cool this is!Had a customer buy twice and tell me my earrings will be in her daughter's wedding!"

It’s an amazing review to me as somebody who not only sells the items I do, but as somebody who has used the type of items I sell (not the ones I send out obviously). Should I thank them for the review? I mean, I’m pretty happy with it.Responding to a Stellar Review"
324,Etsy,"Long story short, I bought a vintage designer wallet for a reasonable price. (aka, it wasn’t suspiciously cheap and it was around TheRealReal—a designer consignment website—prices). And they sold non-designer vintage items in the mix, so it seemed real.

Then I forgot about it. The seller said it shipped, but wouldn’t give tracking info.

A few weeks later, I check in on the shop and people are saying they were getting a mysterious package from China that had their item, but the shop was supposed to be in California. Thus, the item was a fake. I went to bed, checked the shop the next day, and it’s gone. I got the “Uh no!” message, which is what happens when a shop is deleted.

I have USPS Informed Delivery and get updates for packages, even if it comes from China. No packages from China are on my list.

So I requested a refund via a case because the item was never delivered after a month. I added the note that it seems that the items are fakes and not vintage, based on reviews I saw before the shop was shut down. I waited 3 days for the seller to respond, escalated, and instantly got a refund.

Well, just today, I got a USPS notification of a shipment coming from China. It has to be the wallet. No one else in my house has ordered anything besides Amazon Prime items.

So I am technically getting the item, even if it’s fake. Am I entitled to get all my money back, even if I’m getting a product? Do I need to notify Etsy I’m getting *something*? Even if it’s fake? Is the seller going to hunt down my house and go after me for taking $400 back? 😬

And now I’m hoping that US Customs doesn’t think I’m committing some sort of crime by illegally importing a fake Gucci wallet. Can I really get in trouble for that?

This is stressful!Weird situation where I got a refund via opening a case for never getting an item, but...should I contact Etsy to “refund the refund”?"
325,Etsy,"So I got my first 2★ review and I'm just sad and disappointed.
The buyer complains about the size and how long the shipping took. The size is in the description so maybe read for a change?? Also please don't tell me my handmade item isn't well made when you don't bother to read anything. 

But more importantly.. I CAN'T CONTROL THE DAMN TIME IT TAKES TO ARRIVE AFTER I SHIPPED IT!? It even arrived in the estimated delivery time??? 21 out of 14-30 days is apparently too much time to arrive overseas. 

I asked etsy for removal because of the shipping thing but they decided it's totally not against policies and obviously it's my fault we're in a pandemic and shipping takes longer.

Not that it matters but I also have an announcement in my shop stating shipping might take longer due to the ONGOING PANDEMIC??? and an extra note when marking as shipped that it may take longer.

Also contacted the buyer and said I'm sorry he's not satisfied with his order but that I shipped it after a day and everything after isn't in my control and mentioned the other aspects are found in the description. Didn't get a reply after a week. Etsy says it's fine. I'm disappointed.Thanks for nothing, Etsy support"
326,Etsy,"Every once in a while I get messages from other sellers asking how I make my products/where I source. I never now how to respond. Today, I got a message from a fellow seller that said “Hi!

343,Etsy," ***Anyone Having Tracking Label problems? Please read!!!***

So, I ship out a LOT out of my shop, via the USPS. Besides all the *'late'* and *'huge delays'* the USPS is having, I was also having an *EXTREMELY frustrating,* random issue with packages, *not arriving*, and customers asking where they were.

So, upon checking the tracking, the package's tracking would show up as ***""Pre-Shipment - Shipping label created. USPS Awaiting Item.""***

**???**

This ""Pre-Shipment"" status would be on a package that I had **CLEARLY** mailed, inside the Post Office, **WEEKS AGO**.  Why was it saying *""USPS Awaiting Item??""*  
 

Very frustrating, as the item would *not show up to my customer*, and I would have to send out a replacement *100% at my own expense,* over and over.

I felt like I was playing '*Russian Roulette'* when I would drop off multiple items at the post office, because *some* would go to the destination  they were supposed to, and *some would not show up*. So, when questioned by a customer, I would of course, just check tracking, see ***""Pre-Shipment-USPS awaiting Item""*** .....and I knew it was 100% lost. Mail out another one for Free.  
 

So, I went to my local post office today, to ask about it.  


After 45 minutes of investigation, we figured it out. The USPS was baffled at first, because they *swear* that *every package gets scanned*, and released, and there should be *no reason that random ones* would not be scanned, or why they were coming up as the Post Office was waiting for it.  
 

Heres what is supposed to happen:

When we 'print' a ETSY Shipping label, three things should happen:  
 1) We generate a label, electronically generating a number, let's say it's *: #000001*  
 2) Etsy Generates an electronic ***""Package Manifest""*** that *matches our Label Number*, *000001*, and transmits it to the USPS  
  3) The USPS , when they receive our package, and scan it, the software  looks for *#000001*, matches it, and creates the record, tracking, in the system, and it's a *""live package"".*  
 

But, what's happening is, Step #2) in the procedure, *(The ETSY transmittal of the Electronic Manifest)* is being delayed, by ETSY's software, sometimes by a few days. So....  
 

 1) You create your label &amp; drop off to USPS the next day  
 2) But, ***NO Package Manifest is sent to the USPS*** *until up to 3 days later!*  
 3) USPS receives your package, scans it, and into the bin it goes.  
 

However, when it starts to get sorted later, and electronic manifests start matching packages, **YOURS**  has ***NO 'matching"" ETSY package manifest,*** that allows it to be tracked, because ETSY delayed the sending of it, and now, when it's scanned, *(which can NOT be detected by the person scanning it)* your package is an *""orphan""*.   


It has No tracking number...to the system, it *'doesn't exist'* and it apparently goes into a black hole, because these packages ***have NEVER shown up to the people waiting for them***, causing me to have to resend them, at 100% my expense &amp; loss.  
 

**It's a 100% ETSY problem.**   


Today, *(3/9/21)* I brought *7 items* to mail, *(before we figured this out)*, because I wanted to make sure they were scanned in my presence. **AFTER** we  had figured this issue out, the Postmaster went and got my 7 packages that were ***ALREADY SCANNED earlier***,  to do a Manifest Matching search on the software, *as a test.*    


*ONE of the 7 labels* I printed out ***THIS MORNING*** did ***NOT*** have a corresponding Package Manifest sent from ETSY!!!!  
 

He then showed me printouts of the 6 **correct scanned** packages, *(that had the 1/2/3 steps that I mentioned earlier)*. 

***The 7th*** was missing a section, #2, ***the Package Manifest Transaction Number that ETSY generates***.   


This happened right in front of my eyes.  
 

So, he handed me back my tube and said ""Uhhh...That one, is not going anywhere,  You need to buy a new label, and you need to tell ETSY"".   
 

So, at least I know. But, as of today, March 9th, 2021, ***I CANNOT trust labels created by ETSY anymore***.   


I'm going to have to copy addresses and go to the **USPS Click n' Ship**, because I **cannot trust  Etsy** to make 100% guaranteed shippable labels.   
 

This is now a huge pain in the a\*\*, but, I can't afford to keep repackaging and re-shipping out my posters for free to people who don't get their items due to Etsy's software issues. It's costing me too much money.  
 

FYI - *this all started in 2021, January*. I have *had NO issues like this in the prior 3 years*, and I ship a LOT.  
 

Anyway, I wanted to let anyone know, who was having a similar issue.

347,Etsy,"So is it okay for me to request a refund from someone who wants more money on top of the original price they quoted me after I've paid them, regardless of whether or not they do refunds? I'm just irked this seller didn't factor in the additional payment fees and they're ignoring the fact I did indeed send the amount we agreed on and because they didn't get the full amount (due to a small percentage being removed for payment services), they want me to send x amount more. They also don't seem to understand the fact that more fees will be extracted from x amount if I send it, meaning they'll have to ask for more money yet again.

They seem very nice, but idk. This just doesn't look like good business practice. When the seller makes a slip up, isn't it their responsibility to take care of it instead of wanting the buyer to do it?Okay to request refund?"

349,Etsy,"Hi everyone, it would be really great if I can get some guidance from sellers who are located in Germany.

My wife recently opened an Etsy store. She's trying to sell some of her digital designs. She's also registered as a ""small business owner"" with the help of a Steuerberater and got her Steuernummer (which I assume is tax ID) (we've just moved to Germany btw). But now we're learning some new stuffs that we are obligated to state, write, etc in her Etsy page. So we would be most grateful if you could shed some lights to the topics below.

\- Registering to Lucid: I assume this is related to physical products, right? Some people said we should check it out but we're only selling downloadable files. 

\- ODR regulation: My question would be, is it compulsory? If not, do you advise for us to register? For digital products I am not sure if any dispute comes since the prices are quite low. But what do you think?

\- Imprint, terms and conditions, cancellation policy, privacy policy: We've seen so few stores that uploads these documents. Is it compulsory for Germany based stores? If it is, should they be carefully written? Like should we hire some consultant for it?

\- VAT ID: I'm really confused about all the ID's that we have. We thought Steuernummer would be enough but in Etsy there's a place for VAT ID certification upload. As far as I understand we can apply for it but why it is necessary and why it is something ""additional"" we didn't get.

\- Invoices: This is something we both feel stupid... How can we extract all the fees that Etsy charges us as an ""invoice"" so that we can show it as expense? Or are we required to do something like this? Maybe ""monthly statements csv"" is enough? I feel lost for all these invoice and declaration stuff. And probably this is not a Germany-related question... But here it goes.

Next thing you know, I hop on today and I see three new reviews saying that the seller was a scammer. That they never sent it out or that they sent it to a different address. 

Can Etsy sellers even change the address on the shipping label??

353,Etsy,"hi! i just wanted some fellow seller input on an order and message i received today. 

i received a typical order this morning, but then a couple hours later the buyer messaged me. in the message, they claim to have placed the order last week and want to know if they will get it by the 25th. 

that’s plenty of time of course, but their claim about placing it last week felt odd to me. the order the placed today is the only order i have for the buyer. does it sound suspicious or maybe the buyer is just confused? 

i am going to message the buyer back and assure them it should arrive on time, but should i acknowledge the comment about placing the order last week? like i said, it’s their only order and it was placed this morning.Suspicious order?"

355,Etsy,"Something happened in January. While I know that sales take a bit of a dive for us all after the holiday rush, not as badly as I've experienced.

I realize many here make much more than that, but to me its a nice little income. 

I am shocked at what's going on. 89% down for the last three month span overall YOY (year on year).

357,Etsy,"Hi everyone!

I have a question about a recent etsy purchase I did so hope this is the correct place!

I recently purchased a large item from an Etsy shop. These are custom items made to size and are not cheap (mine was about $500 with shipping) I emailed the seller before I purchased asking what size I should get and they told me so that's the size I ordered. When it came in I thought it was a little large but had read other reviews that had similar comments of receiving a larger size than ordered. So I thought okay maybe this is common and it's not that bad I can probably make it work. It was obviously not ideal and definitely harder to work with due to size difference. I was very hesitant to message them though due to the extreme cost of shipping and like I said I had seen other reviews so I thought this was common.  The product is unique and this is my first time using this item and purchasing one.

So I use it maybe three times outside and it gets a little dirty (as it's used outside). The seller messages me and says that I received the wrong product that my product was shipped to someone else and I got theirs which is why it's too big. The seller asked if I could ship mine to the person who got mine and they would ship theirs to me. I said I would love to do that as it really is too big for me, and I told them I want to let you know that I used mine a few times and they asked for a pic so I sent one.

The seller said they would get back with me and a couple of days passed so I followed up and they told me to keep mine since I used it and that I should have measured it before use (which I told them about the other reviews I had seen about theirs coming big). I asked if there was any way that I could still get that one and I would ship the bigger one I received back to them.

The issue now is that to ship it back where I bought it versus where my new one was sent is very expensive due to location distances (with the original sellers being much more than the person who got mine by mistake). 

I'm vague with the product but think of an athletic type item. If I ship it back I know the seller will be able to refinish it and it would essentially be like new.

Please know that I'm not trying to be difficult or unreasonable but definitely would prefer the correct size I ordered as it's already made for me and the seller admitted this is their error I received the wrong product. I'm asking the seller if there's anything else that can be done but was looking for any other input. 

Thank you!Received Wrong Custom Item"

This was only about 2 weeks after I had shipped their order and with the current world environment we all know that unless you are sending courier parcels overseas are taking between 4-6 weeks with standard mail - which is what they chose. It is worth mentioning that I send via untracked mail (but do offer upgraded shipping that includes tracking). Note: For those that are about to flame and say ""you should always send tracked mail"" - I get the risk here so please save your breath. 

I gave the customer the usual reply stating these facts and they replied that all was well and that they would wait. 

Fast forward about a week and I wake up to a case being filed against me for non-delivery. Since Etsy basically backs you into a corner to refund the person I just ate the loss and refunded them after a few days.

Today I got another order from the same person. They did not opt for tracked shipping.

What should I do? Honestly the person was not malicious when they filed a case and there may be some language barrier (they are from Italy). I feel like I should just cancel and refuse to send it unless they pay for tracked shipping. But what about the other items that they probably just kept?

Three weeks after sending the package, I messaged Madison on Instagram about if my package had been received and when I could expect a haul with unfortunately no message returned.

Last night I was fed up &amp; checked Madisons Tik Tok account to see if she had posted my haul, this is when I found a video where she addressed the situation that someone was claiming to be her on Etsy.

401,Etsy,"Last night I typed into the search bar a couple of my products to find where they are sitting in the search results for customers, during this process I found ***not one, not two, but EIGHT*** shops using my photographs to market their products. I take all of my lay flat photos on my branded tissue paper, as well as my online mock ups of other colours with my branding in the background. Not a single one of these shops took the time to alter, crop or remove any of my branding from the photos. ***If you're going to steal - do better, be better.*** 

I have messaged all of the shops and here are some of the responses I have received. 

* ""Sorry about that, done""
* ""I'm sorry, your photo is really nice for my item, but I'm worried changing the photo will prevent Etsy from letting me receive my money, I will delete your photo on 8/3 after receiving money.  
We hope you agree.""
* ""Due to technical errors we have removed the copyright of your image. Thank you very much""

I am not totally sure how a technical error has caused you to steal and promote my photos, but okay? In addition, 3 of the accounts that got back to me just cropped my branding out of the background and left the item photo. This is very disappointing to say the least. 

I have been on Etsy for just about a year now, so honestly I am a little flattered that people want to steal my product images \**hair flip\*.* I saw this happening to other shops around Christmas time and was curious to how people have the audacity to blatantly rip off other peoples designs. I am so curious to what the product looks like if someone actually orders from them? Specifically if they saw my branding and thought they were ordering from me, this could be very bad for my brand overall! 

I have given all of the sellers 24 hours to remove the photographs &amp; then will be filling trademark reports with Etsy directly. 

Does anyone have any experience dealing with sellers like this? Some of the accounts are very clearly all stolen photos with no consistency of branding or photo style. Any advice would be helpful! Thanks!Etsy Sellers stealing my stores photos!"

403,Etsy,"Hello,

I ordered a custom item (designed upon my request) that was also personally sized from an international seller, and paid several hundred dollars.  The item is fantastic, with one small flaw: the seller crafted the item about 10% larger than I specified, and this was enough to make the item unwearable (it slips off).  I'm not innocent in this, though, because I measured my sizing too generously as well.  However, had the item been crafted as I specified, it would have been larger than desirable but still wearable.

I just want the item to fit right, so I asked the seller to resize it and haven't heard back yet.  The seller seems like a fantastic person so I think they'll be fine doing that.  To sweeten the pot, I offered to pay the shipping out to them, and I didn't mention the shipping back out to me.  I'm hoping they'll offer to cover that, but if not, I'll pay that too.  It's going to cost me out the nose, but I like the seller's work.  I just want it to fit right.

I wanted to get opinions on whether this was a reasonable request, and if so, how it should be set up.  I figured I'd ship it back using USPS's Priority Mail International with full insurance coverage.  I've been messaging the seller through Etsy, both because that's my only point of contact and because it keeps things documented.  Would a request like this need to go through Etsy's sales or customer service system at all, perhaps as a return/rebuy?  Anything I haven't thought of?

Thanks!Custom Order Resizing?"

AusPost recommended getting the customer to call USPS to find out what’s happening but as I want this sorted I thought I would just call and see what’s happening, as it was a high value order. Except I’ve been googling for half an hour and called several numbers that don’t work. I know I can email, but I would prefer to talk to a human if possible.

412,Etsy,For background to the story I sell signs in my shop. My bestseller is a wood sign that says “new home new beginning new memories est. 20xx”. I got a message today from another shop owner claiming I copied her “original design” and wants me to take it down or she will contact Etsy. While our signs say the same thing so do thousands of other signs. So I doubt she has a copyright/trademark on the phrase. Also the fonts I use on my sign are allowed for commercial use and are different than the ones she uses. So while they do look similar (both have the same words with mixed script and non script fonts) they are not exactly alike.  To add to that my sign the words are painted on and hers is a vinyl decal. Does she have a chance of getting Etsy to take down my listing?  Any advice would be so helpful. Thanks so much!!Need advice! Another seller threatened to report me to Etsy for selling an item similar to hers.
413,Etsy,"One of my listings is for a niche kit of craft supplies. It's my most popular listing and has the bestseller tag.

My listing description says something like: ""The listing description at the time you place you order determines which items you will get, so if you order and then see the listing description has changed a few hours later, no worries! You'll still get everything you ordered.""

*Magically*, this has never confused anyone. Nothing but well over a hundred five-star reviews.

However, I just read that Etsy doesn't allow us to change items in our listings. But the context was changing an item to something completely different.

418,Etsy,"I just got a notice that USPS adjusted one of my labels; I sold two very lightweight cloth masks. I purchased the label through Etsy, and based on the weight (1.6oz) it should have shipped as a First Class package. I had the package type as a ""package/thick envelope"" as I always do, since I use polymailers for these items.

My email notifying me of the adjustment stated the weight was adjusted to 2oz, and that the USPS classified it as ""Envelope	USPS Flat Rate Small Envelope"". They billed me an additional $4.37 on top of the $3.03 I already paid for the label. The shipping for the labels ($7.40) is almost the same price as the items the customer bought.

Since I purchased it through Etsy, do I have to go through that dinky email they provide for the USPS for disputes? Or, do I have any recourse through my local post office? They know me very well there, and know the packages I scan (I sent hundreds last summer/Christmas).

433,Etsy,"I am trying to drop ship some artwork that I made but I have a lot of questions. For clarification, I'm using Printify, but I'm having trouble figuring out:

1. What items to sell. I love the idea of posters, framed, canvases, and giclee, but I don't know WHICH items to sell for each. Even more frustrating is which poster variation I should sell. There's:

* Posters
* Premium Posters
* Premium matte posters
* Giclee art print

I really want to have a quality product, but it's hard knowing the quality without spending lots of money for a bunch of samples. Can anyone vouch for the quality of these products? Maybe buying samples are really my only option?

I'm also cautious about clogging up my store page adding a whole lot of variations, eg 1 artwork, 3 different listings with a:  Poster variation, Framed Varation, and Canvas Variation. Unfortunately, I was trying to integrate all 3 products into one listing, but Printify wouldn't be able to automatically grab orders.  So the question is if I should those variations or stick to one product?

2)  Pricepoint. I plan to sell \~7 different sizes for each product, but I was looking at the cost for shipment, and it was around $5-13. Is it better for the buyer to each up the cost or offer free shipping? I don't really want it to dig into my costs too much, but I've seen other sellers offer free shipping and it seems to be a really attractive feature.People who sell dropshipped posters from Printify, do you have any advice for navigating the ecosystem of selling your prints?"

442,Etsy,"So I’m planning on selling my homemade paint. I’m in the process of figuring out a ‘recipe card’ so people can understand how pigment &amp; creating paint works. I have the measurements for the ingredients, but it’s only based on using gum Arabic as a binder to complete the paint, which I was planning on including to make it simpler for people to make the paint right away, and not have to go out and buy a binder.

But I’m wondering if I should include a binder to be added to the paint, because after adding a binder, it just needs water, which everyone has access to, and not everyone has access to paint binders like; gum Arabic (what I would sell along with my pigment), honey, acrylic polymer, alkyd polymer, epoxy polymer, egg yolk, etc. I mean there’s so many options. 

If you were to buy paint pigment, would you appreciate/prefer most of the ingredients to make the paint be included? Or would you prefer to create your own recipe for it?I create natural pigment for making my own paint. Paint requires a binder, which there are many options for.

444,Etsy,"So I came across this lady selling crystals on etsy. Gigantic clusters of rose quartz (like huge) at such a decent price, and with free shipping to Canada ( from the US.). She messaged me thanking her for being one of her first sales (she had like 9 sales i think). I replied to her thanking her for allowing me to find her business. Then she send me a picture of the receipt from USPS and it was 55.00 for the shipping alone, the crystal was 46 dollars CAD. She sent the photo of the receipt and said ""im new at this whole shipping thing"". I didnt really know what to say but instantly replied and ask was this the cost JUST to ship it alone? And she replied: 

Yes I already sent it. And yes, that’s what it cost. I hadn’t seen you were in Canada until it was too late. My boyfriend is making fun of me. Lol. It cost me $20 to give a away my crystal.

I guess the shipping cost outweigh the item cost so it is essentially her giving away her crystal. Im not sure even what to reply. Honestly I wish she would have asked me to pay the shipping fee before sending it out, and then i may have paid it but likely would have told her that its a bit too expensive and to cancel my order and id say the reason was that I bought it by mistake so she didn't get penalized and that way she could've sold it to someone locally and made a profit, and simply left the post office after them telling her it was 55 dollars to ship and consolidating me first.

463,Etsy,"Hey everyone, I recently started selling SVG downloads. I have two versions of an svg, a ‘thin line art’ one and a ‘thick border’ one of the same thing. I compress the eps, pdf, png, and svg files into a zip file for each version, and upload the two zip files to etsy for download.
My last two customers messaged me after purchase and said the svg didn’t download. As I recently started selling downloads, I want to know if this is an issue on my end or theirs. Does anyone else have this problem? I am wondering if the ‘html file type’ is confusing people, but that is gonna be an issue from their end.

Any insight would be appreciated! I kind of wish I could simulate buying from myself so I can see what its like from a buyer’s end. Thank you.SVG sellers - SVG didn’t download?"

My hope is to get more traffic to the Shopify store, and maybe save some fees when dealing with new and repeat customers. My only concern was in return affecting my etsy shop. I know success on etsy is largely algorithm based, and I was just fearful that losing repeat and directed customers from etsy to my site would in return cause me to lose out on possible sales and ranking on Etsy.

475,Etsy,"I had a buyer give me a one star review because the costume she purchased did not fit her friend's pet and now I'm debating whether I should publicly respond to their review. 

They messaged me before purchasing and gave me their pet's measurement. When I am asked what size they should order I always tell them to order to their shortest length because if they order to the longest length the costume slips off their pet and the costumes can only be made round. I described my own pets measurement so it's more clear. I also attached a link to a video so that they can ensure that they actually measure their pet right. I have had people guess or measure with a flat ruler which always throws off their actual measurements. I provide pictures of how the pet should be measured in every one of my listing photos. My FAQ and listing descriptions all state where these can be found and how to measure as well as with what to measure. I list in my FAQ that I do not accept returns or exchanges for these costumes (I can't resell them because they request the size they need and they are made to order) but I offer a small discount if the buyer measured incorrectly. I make them to the size they order and they are always measured before being sent out so for them to tell me that it's not the size they ordered rather upset me. If I made a mistake I will fix it which is why I always ask for a picture of the costume being measured. 

This is the review they left me:

""Product is very cute and definitely looks like a donut. Unfortunately, I had first contacted the owner about making sure I got the correct sizing and she responded with vague instructions on how to measure the tortoise. Whenever I received the item, it was much smaller than I expected (and smaller than the requested 4x4) and I'm not even able to use it. I contacted the owner and she told me there aren't any refunds allowed but she would give me 10% off to order yet another one to try and get the size right. I feel that this shop could provide a quality product if they got the sizing right and if the customer service was better.""

I did not respond to the review but rather sent them a message:

""Good evening, I apologize that you were not pleased with your product. Please note that I offered everything possible as to how your shelled friend is to be measured. This included pictures in the listings as well as a video showing exactly how they are to be measured with a soft measuring tape. If this is too vague I would appreciate what would best help you in regards to how your shelled friend is measured. I am always happy to receive suggestions on how to improve. 

I also requested a picture of the costume received to be measured to ensure the measurement. If you could please provide me with that I would be glad to assist you in creating a new costume that fits your shelled friend.""

487,Etsy,"I recently bought a dress from an Etsy seller that was labelled as handmade - they had great reviews and the seller was kind in helping me find my size. 
However, when the item arrived the tag immediately gave me alarm bells and a quick google of the brand took me to Amazon where the dress is £6 cheaper.
Thankfully I bought it on sale so only ended up paying £2 more than I should’ve, and I know I should’ve done more research.
But my question is - is this allowed? I don’t think it’s dropshipping as the seller did repackage it (although it wasn’t personalised, just put into another box and wrapped in paper).
I’m going to tell people in my review that I recommend going through Amazon and I also won’t be returning it as I would have to pay for shipping (it’s also a nice dress...)
I just feel like I’ve been tricked. I wasn’t gullible enough to think it was handmade - I thought it was obvious they got it elsewhere. Still, I paid a lot of money (at least for me being lower class) so I feel cheated.

Edit* it is the same seller on amazon. However their name does not match the tag and I feel they are reselling an item from elsewhere on both sites.
Another edit* apparently it is made by their sister company which explains the name on the tag. Although it’s not handmade I feel they don’t violate Etsy’s guidelines. I feel guilty for not buying a true handmade product and will be more careful in future. I’m sorry.Seller repackaged an Amazon item"

501,Etsy,"Hey everyone! I am heavily considering taking down my shop. It wasn’t until around this past fall &amp; Christmas time that I started having some serious issues with customers, Etsy being unhelpful and USPS in general. I deal with some considerable health issues and cannot work but make the items in my Etsy shop as a therapeutic hobby that happens to sell on a very small scale every now and then which has been really wonderful while I wait for some form of assistance. But this has turned into something way too frustrating if I’m being honest. 

Some background: I just had my very first package be destroyed by USPS before Christmas. It was to no fault of myself and was very obviously someone not paying attention and throwing or maybe even stomping on the box, or so it looked like when the buyer sent me images. What the buyer and I agreed upon was filing a claim to have the cost reimbursed (I only send my fragile items with priority as the absolute minimum shipping service) as there wasn’t really enough time for them to get a replacement from me in time to gift it. They ended up filing it themselves to get their money back because it was easier for them to handle it and bring it in to their local USPS because they ask to inspect it before they cut you a check. I would have done it for the customer but I didn’t have the item in question or the packaging and we obviously weren’t going to send it back to me to handle it, if that makes sense.

Just now I had my 2nd sale since Christmas time and I packaged the item up nicely and shipped it out as I have always done. I package my items VERY carefully because they are framed butterflies and they go behind glass. I also always send a photo to the customer before sending to verify everything is in good space. The client just got their butterfly in the mail today and what do you know? The frame has a stab/impression mark in it. I am not sure how this happened from transit since it is such a small hole/stab mark but unless the person did it themselves (which I believe to be highly unlikely), then this is obviously damage from USPS despite all of my packaging and fragile stickers. The frame was brand new before I sent it out I literally opened it that day and checked it over a bunch of times. My only issue here is that the photo I sent of it to prove its condition and verify the item with the buyer somehow JUST cropped the very top few centimeters of the frame which just so happens to be where the mark is! Fantastic! 

I am worried the customer thinks I sent it to them like that intentionally or if this leads for some reason to an Etsy case, Etsy will not be helpful to me. I do offer exchanges as long as they are in good faith/appropriate timing. Since they just received it a few hours ago I obviously have no problem with this and I apologized and asked them if they would like to exchange it for a brand new one which OR we can go about a USPS claim. 

[ Side note: I am honestly worried about my reviews at this point which were officially kind of ruined after Christmas by a lunatic that wanted their money back and admitted there was nothing wrong with their item, just that they were dealing with financial issues due to COVID and it being after x-mas they had no money. I had no issues with my items or customer service up until this point and had all 5 stars, this review was extortion and my first 1 star. Etsy ended up siding with me in the end but refunded the buyer out of their own pocket which is obnoxious and encourages this behavior on the platform. ]

But anyways dealing with another headache like this is not what I want to be doing right now. I am pretty over all of the stress brought with the responsibility of owning an Etsy shop and having to trust USPS to be careful with fragile packages and make it right for people even if the damage isn’t my fault. I quite literally just dealt with some weird person from the UK harassing me over messages non-stop yesterday and I had to refuse the sale from them so not to get involved with a Karen. I would mostly like to settle this current frame dent issue (about the size of a knife tip or ballpoint pen) and then just close out my shop completely. 

My question is what should I do from here to ensure a good customer service job on my end and make this customer happy? I can’t really afford to shell out the full cost of the item to refund it and send a new one free of charge. That’s a ton of materials, time &amp; a lot of money for me at this time. I’m sure they don’t want to keep it because the dent bothers them as it would anyone. Do I just stay firm and ask that they return it to me and I’ll send a brand new one? Should I stay on the USPS route and have them purchase a new one once reimbursed and they can keep the broken one? I am not sure at this point is the right thing to do. I am not sure if I will return to Etsy or not at any point in the future after this. I hope this doesn’t sound like whining as I’m sure a lot of you guys deal with much bigger shops/constant clients and stuff and deal with this on a much larger scale. But I’ve only made under 60 sales and I’ve been on Etsy for well over a year and this isn’t easy for me or good for my health condition which is related to trauma and stress. 

Sorry for kind of ranting, thank you guys.Losing my mind with USPS/Etsy"
502,Etsy," I have an Instagram page where I promote my jewelry and I engage with my customers and other seller and even made a few friends, I made a group chat with a few sellers and we all share tips on selling and help each other out with sales and boost each other’s posts and help with questions etc. I created a certain bracelet that’s gotten really popular and I’ve made many sales from it, other sellers who also make bracelets are asking where I got the beads from or ask me for links. I don’t feel like it’s appropriate to give them that information, I normally don’t gate keep and I’m very open with sharing where I get certain products but I feel like I should maybe draw the line when it comes to what I’m selling cause it doesn’t make sense to share that information. I also noticed a few of the other sellers copy a lot of the things I do I normally don’t care but it’s getting a bit annoying. 

I know of some sellers who make others pay for their vendor list. For me I would rather not share it. I already shared with another seller who asked me and she was a bit rude about it and learned my lesson. Am I wrong for this? please let me know. And if I’m right what should I answer them when they ask without being rude? 
Thanks


Edit: since writing this I had 3 more people ask where I get my things and another asking to use an idea I came up with it’s getting really annoying now! And I appreciate all the responses thank youShould I tell other sellers where I get my products"

504,Etsy,"Hello! 

I sell stationery on Etsy and I have transitioned to no tracking order to all of my orders being tracked. I used to sell my sticker packs with free shipping, so all orders placed would be sent out with a stamped envelope. This did not work out well as almost 10 of my orders shown up missing just as of last month. I can’t track the order so I can’t tell if it’s delayed, lost, or the customer simply scammed me. Of course, according to the customer, I have either refunded or replaced said item, however being a small business, I can’t afford to do this anymore. I know that if an item is deemed lost, then the shop owner is responsible for it but I don’t feel as if it’s fair that I have to pay for USPS’ mishaps. Since I found no other advice, I updated my shop so that all of my orders are tracked as of recently but unfortunately, my traction has gotten lower due to the fact that I added tracked shipping only. 

Since I sell domestically, tracking does not go over $4. However if I do sell stickers then I don’t know if customers would think it’s worth it to buy something that’s equal to the shipping price.

I feel like I’m asking for the obvious but I can’t seem to find other help elsewhere. Is no tracking worth it? Should I go back to offering free shipping and get many customers or offer tracked shipping only and get little to no traction?Is no tracking worth it?"
505,Etsy,"I'm so annoyed. I turned on Vacation Mode 2 months ago, and I haven't opened the sellers app since. I've gotten notifications of ""favorites"" and just silenced them. However, I just got an email about an order, though no notification at all. I opened the app and Vacation Mode was toggled off, which I did not do.

I've had my shop on vacation because I've had hyperemesis gravadium and have been hooked up to an IV bag. It's so hard to function day-to-day that I've been staying with my parents, so I'd need to make a special trip home just to complete the order. I explained to the customer that my shop was supposed to have been on vacation and gave him the option of a refund, or a slight delay in shipping. Either way, is this something that I need to worry about happening after my baby is born? There's no way that after a c-section I'm going to want to get a surprise order. 

Has this happened to anyone else? Is there an expiration on vacation mode where it automatically turns back on?Vacation Mode turned itself off"
506,Etsy,"After Etsy started using Asendia, I had a bad experience with an international package being stuck in limbo for a long time without updated tracking info. A bunch of people in the Etsy forum recommended Pirate Ship to avoid this kind of thing because they'd ship directly to the country rather than to a local facility where the labels would be switched. 

I got an email yesterday from Pirate Ship saying that they had to start using Asendia. So, is it pointless to use Pirate Ship now for international shipping? Are there any rate differences?So, Is Pirate Ship Pointless Now?"
507,Etsy,"New to Etsy just made my first sale and want to make sure I’m doing everything right!

508,Etsy,"I have a sticker store. Most of my stickers are $3-4 and I ship them first class letter mail due to them being so light so that I can offer free shipping for my customers. Customers can choose to upgrade to tracked shipping if they want to for approximately $3, but most don't unless they're placing a big order.

This buyer in particular placed an order in the beginning of February. I shipped out the order. Two weeks-ish later, they contact me to say it hasn't arrived. Etsy's dismal letter tracking also shows it hasn't yet arrived, it stopped in a city along the way and tracking hasn't updated since. I send out another order since they only ordered one thing, I'm willing to pay out of pocket to try it again, so I confirm with the buyer that the address is correct and ship again. Another two weeks go by and they say that it still hasn't arrived (Going from Seattle to Texas). They want me to ship out a third order with tracking. At this point after sending the second one free, I went from profit to breaking even, at this point sending out a third, especially with the cost of tracked package, I'm going to be paying them to take it.

I'm tempted to cut my losses and say I am unable to continue to attempt to fill the order, refund the buyer, and apologize that USPS seems to be incapable of finding their address, but what would you all do? I don't know if they're saying they didn't arrive because they want multiples which would be odd because my stuff is pretty cheap, but I can't afford to keep sending out orders to an address that clearly doesn't seem to be working.

I offer tracked shipping if people want to pay for it but I don't want to force it due to the fact it would double my buyers' costs. I've had about 250 orders in my shop so far, this is the first one that hasn't arrived.When would you just cut your losses and just refund a buyer?"

510,Etsy,"I am switching over to craftybase for my bookkeeping after finding that neither quickbooks nor godaddy were going to work well for me without a whole lot of extra work. 

I work in mixed media and have figured out how to track pretty much everything else except for junk jewelry. Some of it I get for free, some of it I buy in lots off of ebay. Thank god it's not something I use a ton of, but many of my pricier pieces incorperate it or are made out of it almost entirely. I could go by the piece but most of it gets totally deconstructed and used part by part. I could go by weight, but even pieces made totally out of junk jewelry have weight added from adhesives and stuff, and sometimes parts are removed and discarded as well. Also some pieces are made with some new components and some junk jewelry. To make it more complicated, the lots I have gotten have included inexpensive costume stuff, vintage stuff, and sterling silver/semiprecious stones. I charge more for pieces that incorperate vintage, silver, and gems compared to the items that don't. Like a lot more sometimes. 

At this point, since I spent so little on it last year, I'm considering just adding it as a non-inventoriable expense and then just not including it in COGS data. But at least for going forward, what kinds of workable systems have others worked out?How in the hell are you supposed to track COGS when you purchase materials is huge mixed lots?"

I stumbled upon what looks like the exact same ring on Etsy today--the same size, stone ct, etc...for $395.  What a markup!

The seller has 75 positive reviews and almost a perfect rating...but has no return policy as far as I can tell.

514,Etsy,"I see a lot of people complaining about receiving packages beyond delivery estimated time. Yes, it’s frustrating to purchase something and have it arrive beyond your purchase or holiday. However, leaving negative reviews on the shop/product is just you being a jerk. 

If you live in the States, then you should know better. We all know that the USPS is backed up and has been backed up since our whole “save the post office” and “help out small businesses”, due to COVID-19 and influx with online purchasing.

I could say that I’ve been purchasing from Etsy for those exact reasons. Yes, some packages arrive quicker than others, but that doesn’t say anything about the shop. It says that certain counties have less workers. Example, I live in a metropolitan area, and my friend’s dad works at the local post office. He says that we are receiving mail to be processed from the other side of the country, just to be processed here and sent back over there. Why? Because we need more workers. Why? More purchases, consumerism, quick delivery.

So what does this have to do with reviewing items on Etsy? Well, one should be reviewing the product and or shop. What was your interaction like? How was the product? Was it what you expected? We don’t purchase on Amazon, receive things beyond the promised 2 day shipping, then go back and give the Amazon app a 1 star or a, “if I could, I would give it zero stars because my package was late.” Like, c’mon people! It’s not the shop’s fault your package came late! Use your friggen noggin, figure out (constructively) the actual reasons you’re upset, and remember that your negative review hurts small businesses.

I am not a seller. I am a woman who reads reviews before buying, and I just got a little irritated having to sift through reviews that complain about something that has nothing to do with the shop or product, and all to do with postal services. Don’t get me wrong, I appreciate those negative reviews that talk about the product or customer service, because frankly, I’m not trying to support negative shop owners or spend money on poor product.

Also, while I’m here and in this rant.. **if you know it’s Christmas and most people shop on the app during or for holiday, look for presents throughout the year instead of last minute. Chances are, your package will arrive on time! Any super last minute purchases could be on Amazon or in person. That way, you don’t backfire trying to help small business with your negative review that it arrived late.

Update: thank you so much for the awards and upvotes! I truly hope that you and your businesses have much success this year.. and hopefully, more buyers will use their noggin and give more constructive reviews. I agree, taking the stars out would definitely help! Wish nothing but the best for you lot :)A friendly reminder on postal delivery and reviewing shops or products"

Is this true? I personally have never used an Etsy label and don't know how they work, but I do find it weird that they don't have tracking.

525,Etsy,"I bought a pretty custom ring from a seller back in mid December. They had wonderful reviews, and pretty much everything looked similar to the pictures that were listed so I felt really confident. I reached out with some questions about customizing it and she told me that would be no issue at all (My husband passed away suddenly in a car accident, and I lost a lot of weight from the stress so my rings don't fit very well anymore. I wanted to continue wearing something meaningful, which I explained). We seemed to get everything sorted out, and I just waited.

A couple days ago I got my ring, and I was upset to discover it not only didn't look anything like it was supposed to, but it was also way bigger and doesn't fit me. It is my order for sure because it has the right customizations (my husband's initials), just nothing else, and I'm honestly not sure what happened?

I'm preparing to open my Etsy digital shop and I'm wondering about how to organize categories inside my shop. To describe everything clearly I will use an example of selling digital prints.

Let's say I will be selling different styles of prints with various colors. If I will have my own website I will make categories by style - for example: boho, marble, neon, animal prints, etc. I will make also categories by colors - for example: black &amp; white, gold, rose gold, blue, etc.

But I'm wondering what categories create in my Etsy shop. Should I make categories by styles &amp; colors? What if I'll want to sell something else and not only digital prints (but still similar items so creating another shop will be not the best idea).  

For me, shop like that will look better and will be easier to navigate for potential clients but I will need to make multiple listings for the same item (for example: gold leopard print will be in categories ""gold"" and ""animal prints""). When I'm checking other shops almost all of them have a mess in categories and look ugly. I don't know maybe people don't care about things like that but for me, it looks bad. If I will not make categories as I mentioned above then it will be hard to find something in my shop. But maybe no one is looking for items inside the shop but only from search?

Let's say I want to make a sticker (or set) that can fit in a letter. I'm pretty clueless and navigating the USPS website and other things is... intimidating. I'll have a list of questions so they're easier to answer! They're all in reference to US shipping, unless it mentions international.

1) Do you ship stickers in a letter, flat, or bubble mailer? Machinable or non machinable?

2) A lot of sticker makers mention putting cardstock in them to prevent the stickers from bending or getting folded. Wouldn't this make it non-machinable?

3) Do you offer tracking with your stickers? If so, how do you get it so cheap? I'd like to offer tracking for seller protection, but today I went to USPS and shipped a flat with tracking for $10! 

I hear a lot of etsy scammers target sticker shops with no tracking so they get more free stickers. I'm interested in hearing about ya'lls opinion.

4) For those who print labels at home, how exactly is it done? I know this sounds really dumb, but do you just print it out on regular paper and tape it to the envelope? Do you print it on sticker/label paper? From just a normal printer?

539,Etsy,"Hi! So I purchased 3 scrunchies from a seller in Toronto, Canada (I am in United States, California) on January 6, 2021 and they shipped them January 13, 2021. They did not provide tracking information. 














On January 28, I asked the seller for tracking information (I told her the package wasn't late, but if she had it I like tracking the package.) and she said she didn't buy tracking and put it in a mailbox. 














February 10 (original estimate was February 3) I tell her I still haven't received them, she told me that she will check with the post office. She never got back to me. I checked in February 19, and February 24 with no reply. 















I know that the postal office is crazy, but I have received packages from Japan, South Korea, China, England, and Australia within this time period (wedding stuff - don't judge me!) and they all had tracking.

541,Etsy,"I know USPS is still dealing with significant delays in many areas, but I've noticed a trend in the packages I've sent that are being excessively delayed or lost in transit, and I'm wondering if anyone else is experiencing something similar or has any insights.

When I ship stickers I use the ""Flat"" package type for my rigid cardboard mailers.  For a 6x8 mailer this only costs $1.40 and provides a tracking number that starts with ""003"" rather than the typical ""9"".  

During the peak of holiday delays, I was informed by multiple postmaster generals that this ""003"" tracking number was not a ""real"" tracking number that could be looked up by USPS. After doing some poking around in the Esty subreddits I learned that the tracking provided for flat mailers is not specific to the individual package, but is provided based on the scan of the bin housing the package (which is why you can't track down the individual piece of mail should there be a problem).

I only experienced a handful of issues during the holiday rush, with most flat mailers being successfully delivered, so I continued to use that setting knowing it came with a little risk.  Conversely, I've not had nearly as many issues with padded envelopes - a few were dramatically delayed around the holidays, but all ended up arriving eventually (which is particularly great because handmade art is a lot harder to replace than stickers). 

Now, in the last two months, almost every flat mailer I send out is getting stuck marked ""in transit"" indefinitely.  I've even had a couple be delivered, but their tracking still just shows ""in transit"" (the only reason I know they arrived is because I received a review of the item!)

So based on this experience, I guess I'll be switching back to padded mailers and charging $3+ for sticker shipping (which seems crazy!), because at this point I'm losing money on sending out so many replacements.

**Has anyone else had any similar issues with flat mailers, or have any advice for something I might be doing wrong?**

It's not so much complaint as I am perplexed as to how I could get the other package from Ukraine so fast. Also, Jpost  didn't offer any tracking and from Ukraine tracking was automatically added and pricing was totally similar. I just don't get it. 

It makes me not want to order from Japan if it's going to be so stringent and strange with shipping times taking weeks upon weeks for a small light package from Tokyo.

The only other thing I did was delete my first dummy item from account creation. From the Youtube tutorials I read this all seemed like normal setup.

547,Etsy,"I was doing some market research, and came across a shop that sells digital patterns.

Curious, I looked at the shop. All of the patterns appear to be scanned from other people's work, i.e., from books, old stand-alone patterns, etc. None of them are original. (That I saw)

Now, my understanding of the First Sale Doctrine is that it is ok to sell an item that is copyright, as long as you do not retain a copy. For example, if you sell a CD, it is illegal to also retain a copy of the music, because that is copyright infringement. As seller is reselling these, multiple times, they are violating the First Sale Doctrine.

The seller puts no identifying information on the patterns, so it is impossible to identify the source, but they photos and text specifically show that these are not original, but taken from the work of others. 

Now I know things do go into the public domain eventually, but these items are from the 1960's, 70's, 80's, etc. 

Am I missing something? This shop has thousands and thousands of sales. Seems like it goes against the heart of what Etsy is supposed to be about.Please correct me if I am missing something"

551,Etsy,"Hi everyone, I'm a new Etsy seller and i only opened my store last month, but I'm encountering an issue where I think a buyer is trying to scam me for a refund or a free product. About 10 days ago I sent her an order, I sell ceramics so she bought a big bowl and a small bowl. I had never sold two pieces together, so I had to package it differently than I normally do (important later). She messaged me this morning saying she only received one of the items, the smaller bowl. I was very confused at first, because I did send her both, I make to order so it's not like I have a spare large bowl sitting around, and it's not like I have enough orders where I could confuse them, this was on the only one I had to send this week. Just to make sure nothing happened, I asked her to send me a photo of the packaging, just to make sure I didn't accidentally send her the wrong one, and the photos she sent me were of the special packaging I had to buy specifically for her order, to fit both the large bowl and the small bowl. The packaging is too big for me to have used it just to send the small bowl. 

I'm not really sure what to do from here on, because I definitely sent her both the large bowl and the small one, what do you guys think happened? Is it possible that it could have been taken out in customs or anything ? I'm not sure.Advice on dealing with Buyer ?"
552,Etsy,"I've now had 4 instances where a customer has contacted me saying that Etsy stated their order should have arrived by now so why isn't it dispatched?

Of course I'm working hard to beat that but it's only recently I've managed to get to that point, and eventually plan on reducing it back down again.

However if Etsy are telling customers it's due to them over a week before I should even have shipped it, it's no wonder I get messages all the time!

564,Etsy,"I finally reached 1,000 sales a couple weeks ago!
Here’s my [shop.](https://www.etsy.com/shop/societalstickers/) 

I started my shop in June, and I didn’t think it would go anywhere. I can’t draw, can’t do digital art, can’t take photos, can barely use Photoshop. It’s honestly shocking that the shop has made it so far, so I thought I’d write down some thoughts and reflections for other non-skilled sticker sellers:

1. Establish a unique (?) style that sets you apart from other sticker sellers. I think that the Etsy sticker market is definitely over-saturated, especially with cutesy, planner-type, stickers. My shop only started picking up steam when I switched to vintage pulp magazine-type stickers. Donating all of my proceeds is also something that set it apart.

2. Start with low quality. This might seem counterintuitive, but I started with stickers that were mostly not waterproof, not glossy, cut poorly, cheap packaging. I make all of the stickers in-house, and I couldn’t afford to laminate or buy a Silhouette. It was only after some time that I understood there was real potential in my shop, and started buying better supplies and packaging.

3. Take good photos. Photos don’t need to be artsy or beautiful. They need to show off the product, with accurate colors. My photos aren’t the best. They aren’t pretty or uniform (with the same background). But I do try to edit them to be vibrant and crisp. I make sure that the sticker stands out against the background. I usually use moleskine notebooks as the background w direct, golden hour, lighting.

4. Social media is overrated. I think for some products they might work, especially products that look like they would belong on Pinterest, but my shop doesn’t have any social media. I’ve never bought ads. Maybe one of these days I’ll set up an Instagram, but I’ve never really felt the point (esp w my crappy photography skills).

5. Don’t stress out too much about more superficial aspects, like packaging or fixing that 4-star review. I have a ton of 4-star reviews from people with didn’t read the description, or thought the sticker would be larger. None of those things are my fault, and some people are destined to find fault in everything. My average is still 5 stars, so who cares? Also having crappy packaging is better for the environment. For a while, I was just using old magazines to wrap stickers.

6. Add new products frequently. Every week, I try to add another sticker. I also remove listings that aren’t doing well, and have only sold twice. Why? Because it’s hard to keep so many different types of stickers constantly in stock.

7. For shipping: try to do free shipping. I know it’s hard, but all of my listings have free shipping. I also ship w/o tracking using stamps. In practice, it means that a lot of stickers don’t arrive, but I’ve found that shipping out a new sticker is much cheaper than shipping w/o tracking or having to pay for gas to drive to the post office to drop off a package.

8. For the more technical aspect: don’t underestimate SEO. Use a diverse set of tags (decals, vinyl, waterproof, etc). Use multiple words in tags, and use all of your tags. Also, for product descriptions, make sure they’re clear and make sense to the reader. Minimal grammatical mistakes. Use many photos (I’m not perfect on this).


Anyways, that’s all I have for now. Good luck everyone!1,000 sales! + reflections on stickers"
565,Etsy,"I’m thinking of opening a store that’ll sell some art supplies like glitters, dried flowers and paintbrushes. I tried to google and checked the policy on Etsy. It seems it’s allowed but it’s not entirely clear if supplies have to be handmade too.

Thanks in advance :)!Are stores that sell art supplies allowed?"
566,Etsy,"A couple of weeks ago you may have seen my post 'My shop has disappeared!'. Turned out it had been hacked. Loads of transactions, buying and selling, had been put through. All were stopped by both Etsy and my bank, but it caused me a lot of time and hassle and probably some sales. My shop was closed for about a week, I had to get a new bank card, change my password for my shop, enter new card details and then found out this horrible person had also amended the price and quantity and shipping details of every item in my shop.

So, got a new card, updated my shop, Etsy put me back on line and it has happened again within a few days. What is going on? Is it happening to anyone else?

This time I was lucky enough to pick it up very quickly, contact Etsy and my bank. Now have to wait about 5 days for a new card and do it all over again.

Here’s what I really want to respond with to their review: 

Hi *buyer*,

Fortunately, this sounds like a user error and will be an easy fix! As stated in the item description, this item comes with 2 files. One includes a perforated line to act as the scoring line and the other is a blank card that you can add your own scoring line into. I sent you a message and would love to walk you through your difficulties! Please feel free to reply and we can easily get this figured out.

580,Etsy,"Hi! I just recently decided to start selling prints of my photographs on Etsy and I was planning to print them myself to start, but the biggest I can print at home is 8x10. I see that most people selling photo prints, as far as I can tell, don't have anything smaller than that and always have lots of larger options also.

581,Etsy,"Posting this for my husband, since he doesn't have Reddit.

He sent a package from the US to Canada that shipped November 20th.

Tracking says on November 20th Departed USPS Regional Facility. November 24th In Transit To Next Facility. And that's where it ends. Normally, the next line for Canada will be customs clearance, but that isn't there.

The customer contacted him towards the end of January, stating that she hasn't received it yet. He didn't know if it was the holiday rush or an issue with customs, so he asked her to contact her local post master, because he figured the package was in Canada by that time. She didn't respond or follow up again.

Today (March 1st), she contacted him and says the Canada website says ""The product associated with this tracking number does not qualify for this type of service ticket. Please go back to the previous page and double-check the eligibility requirements.""

He asked her what the post office told her. She didn't respond, but she opened a case against his shop.

590,Etsy,"Totally just a rant, but I had to get it out somewhere.   


I had someone post a 4 star review for me today, that was kinda snarky and implied that the plant may not live, but they must have posted a five star initially unless I missed where you can post a pic now with a less than 5-star review. I wish I could get the picture removed. 

The picture is of the plant that they bought from me...I guess. But the plant doesn't look like anything I have ever sent out. She received it two weeks ago. The leaves look thin and dry and dull and she has it repotted in the completely wrong medium and in a mason jar with no drainage. It's a plant that should be kept constantly moist and in orchid moss. And I have 2500 of them, so I would have no reason to send anything that looked like what she has. But I am guessing she is just killing it with it being in the wrong container and medium. 

Since she didn't message me to say that she was having any problems, I sent her a long message explaining that it will die if she doesn't repot it back into the same kind of media I sent it in, and pointed out specific things that were wrong with it now that being in the wrong media was causing, gave her suggestions on where to get the right stuff, and told her I would be happy to walk her thru repotting this very specific, specialty type of plant that I have been professionally growing for years.

She responded and told me that she saw someone else do it on Youtube the way she did and they said that was better for the plant, so despite the fact that she is knocking \*my\* stars off, post pictures of it in medium I don't want anyone else to try to use, and the plant no longer even looks like anything I sell in just two short weeks, she can't take my advice as a grower over that of a YouTuber.

Guaranteed, when it dies in two weeks she will change her review and say it came that way.Just another rant about plants."

I hand make all of my stickers and design all of them on Procreate with my iPad. I love making stickers surrounding some of my favorite childhood snacks and animes!

I feel so grateful and my heart is so full that people want to stick my stickies on their beloved things. I'm still new to selling but here are some things  I did that I think really helped my shop:

* Taking great product photos, I think natural sunlight is the best way to show off your product! I also created a custom filter preset on the Lightroom app so all my listings share a similar color theme/style which helps give your Etsy a more 'cohesive' look in my opinion :D
* Adding personal details to your packaging, I handmade all my packaging supplies and write a handwritten note with every order so the buyer knows how much I appreciate them for shopping at DibDabDoo!
* Posting on TikTok and other social media platforms. I know it can be hard to post consistently so I recommend creating content in large batches. Instead of just making 1 tik tok or 1 instagram post, try to create 3-4 pieces of content all at once so you have content to post throughout the week

I hope these tips help others and hope everyone has an amazing day because I feel on top of the world right now!! ❤️I just hit 100 sales! 🥳❤️"
597,Etsy,"Tl;dr: Custom Valentine's day gift showed up 2 weeks late and very incorrect. Opened a case and the Seller offered me a new item, but I just want to send it back for a refund and be done with it and them. What do I do?

Ordered a custom knife based off an existing listing. The listing was for a plain wood handled folding knife **without a pocket clip**. I asked for some details to be changed (brass to copper, different type of wood for the handle), that the knife be **specifically oriented for a left-handed person** to use, and I needed it **before Valentine's day**. Seller assured me all of these customizations could be done within the timeframe, so I finalized the order on 1/28.

2/5 (estimated delivery date) came and went so I messaged the seller to check. I figured a custom order would take a little longer and the seller confirmed my thinking, said it would be shipped ""next week"". Not a problem at all.

2/12 still haven't heard anything and figure it's the last day to get it in the mail so that is have it by V-day, so I message again. Seller hits me back and says they thought they had all the parts for the customizations when I paid, but they actually didn't and the guy they ordered the part from is running behind. They told me again that the item would ship ""next week"", which fucking sucked. I didn't have time to figure out an alternate gift and if I had known they couldn't do it within my timeframe I would have ordered from another shop or figured something else out. Pissed but whatever, shit happens. Around this time the seller gets really difficult to get in contact with.

I reach out once or twice with questions about the product and shipping to no response. On 2/18 I check again and see they marked it ""shipped"" the day before (2/17) with no tracking number or info. Figure it won't be long now.

Check again on 2/24, no tracking updates since 2/22, so I check back everyday after that for updates meanwhile also contacting the seller for info on shipping insurance (he didn't pay for any, $150 item insured by usps for $50), no response from seller.

**2/27 it finally arrives**, with a label that was purchased on 2/19 (so their self-reported ship date was a straight up lie). The brass details are copper, which is correct to what I ordered. However while the thumb stud (opening mechanism) of the knife is oriented for a lefty, **the liner lock (closing mechanism) is oriented for a right-handed person still.** Additionally there is a **pocket clip attached with two screws into the wooden handle**, when the original listing did not mention a pocket clip in the pictures nor the item description and I never approved the addition.

Same day I opened a case since it was profoundly late *and* incorrect, refund as the ideal resolution. Seller argued that people love pocket clips and that I could detach it myself if I didn't want it. I pointed out all the other issues with the order and that detaching the clip would leave two unfinished screw holes in the wood handle leaving it more suceptible to chipping and minor water damage.

Seller is now telling me to keep the knife and they'll send me a new one when I'd rather just have the refund. It's a custom order, so I understand that a refund is not typical, but it's literally an item that is not what I ordered and arrived two full-ass weeks after I needed it. I'm perfectly happy to send it back, and after as bad as they fucked this up I just DON'T want to work with them again. I don't want another knife, I just want my money back.

How do I proceed? Do I have any recourse since they ARE technically offering me a solution, or can I refuse their offer? And lastly, do I even have a chance at a refund on this custom order?I had to open a case with a shop and I requested a refund. Now the seller is saying they'll just send me a new item when I'd really prefer the refund. What do I do?"
598,Etsy,"So I found a seller that does customized items that I really would like. They have at least 5-7 different sample photos of their work and it's all lovely, but they don't have a single review nor any sells. This person is charging around $60 for their handcrafted products, while other sellers typically charge around $80-$150 for similar handmade items. 

I'd love to support this person, and I'd even leave a review for them once I got my product, but a part of me is a little wary of if this is a scam. I've tried looking up other platforms on social media they might use and all I found was an inactive Instagram that was made roughly 4 years ago that has no content on it.

So I'm unsure if I should trust this seller and go for it or back out. Thoughts or suggestions?

Also, if I did go with it and never got my product, is there any guarentee Etsy could help me out in getting a refund?Trustworthy or not?"

607,Etsy,"Hi guys

I recently tried to purchase an item through Etsy from a seller with 0 ratings, no store policies written and no description of the store is available on Etsy as well. Additionally, the item that they are selling is sold out everywhere, but is somehow listed as in stock still after being active the whole day after a number of people had purchased it.

After doing a bit of reverse google image searching, I found the picture of the seller to be for another more Established Etsy account. I reported the store, and not to my surprise, the other item they were selling could be found in a reverse google image search to another page.

I've paid for the item through Paypal, and cancelled the payment as the payment was not received. 

I might be a bit paranoid, but I think the scammer would have our address. I don't feel comfortable about that at all lol. am I unreasonable to think so? 

How does the process work going forward? Does paypal reach out to the seller to let them know I cancelled the pending payment?Etsy - bought from scammer, cancelled payment to seller."
608,Etsy,"Hi, my buyer accidentally bought the same item twice, so I'm cancelling the 2nd order and refunding them. This is the first time I've ever had a cancellation, so I want to understand if I am reading this correctly.

The item was $19 with $2 shipping, for $21 total. I understand the fee credits that Etsy is giving back to me [see photos here](https://imgur.com/a/3iC6157) because I currently have $18.87 in my payment account and fees taken out were for the payment processing fee ($0.88), the transaction fee ($0.95), and the shipping fee ($0.10). I guess they won't refund the 0.20 autorenewal listing fee since I had multiples, but that's fine. 

The part where I am confused is in the second photo in the link I shared where it says $1.25 will be charged to my Discover to cover the remainder of the refund. I believe that number comes from the transaction fee ($0.95) and the shipping fee ($0.10) plus the listing fee of $0.20 that it charged for the autorenewal. I assume that Etsy will credit me that $0.95 + $0.10 and I'll just have to pay the $0.20 for the listing? It seems like such a weird way to go about it, but I'm reading this correctly, right? Thanks


UPDATE: I went ahead and submitted the cancellation and Etsy did refund my 0.20 listing, so that's nice. I still have a payment account balance of $1.05 now that I owe, so I hope I get those credits.First time canceling &amp; refunding an order, not sure if I am being charged for the cancellation"

611,Etsy,"Hey friends,

Hoping for some help / insight if anybody else has had success with this.

The TL;DR is that I want to create my own self-branded shop that can sync with Etsy. The reason is I have one item that sells well on Etsy and brings its own traffic. The other items have sold through self-generated traffic. 

I started with square because I had already integrated that with Etsy. I bought a reader in hopes of attending and selling my crafts at local festivals and shows, and not have to worry about overselling inventory (but, you know. Covid). 

I had hoped to just keep using Square on my self-hosted website with Wordpress / Woocommerse but so far that has been a nightmare, and from what I've read It's probably not worth pursuing. 

I was thinking about maybe switching over to Shopify as it looks like there are some plug-ins that allow this to work, but that appears to be more expensive. I'm not selling enough right now to balance out how much that would cost to pay for Shopify as well as the subscription for that plugin. 

So I was wondering if anybody else has had any luck here? I don't mind paying for platforms / plugins but I don't want to invest a ton of money that I'm not making back on solutions that aren't going to work. 

Any suggestions would be amazing. I hope this wasn't too wordy!

Thank you!Has anybody had any luck syncing inventory between Etsy &amp; Wordpress / Woocomerse?"

619,Etsy,"I purchased a ring (not cheap) from an Etsy seller back in early January. She makes it known up front that it will take a month to create and then ship it to me (international shipment from Swiss Post to USPS).

I received a confusing email last week from Etsy saying that the order had been delivered. It had not been. As far as I knew, it had not even been shipped yet.

I messaged the seller to ask her why the item was listed as delivered. She gave me a tracking number that she said she would be using for my shipment. She also gave me some proof that she did indeed mail something to the US. Okay, so I checked out the tracking number she gave me for USPS. It was used to successfully deliver something to a completely different city and state in the US back in November of 2020. So the status of that tracking number is Delivered. It's of no use to me.

I asked her why she was using this old tracking number. She said the numbers are issued by the Swiss Post.  I emailed USPS to ask if my item would be successfully delivered even with a recycled tracking number. They told me to go ask the Etsy seller for a new tracking number. So, I contacted the seller with that question. Suddenly, she announces her shop will be shut down for at least a month because she needs to 'catch up on things'. Am I screwed here? The only thing I have is this info from the Swiss Post:

**22:52**  
**Forwarding abroad**  
**8010 Zürich Briefzentrum International**

They had given a time frame that states within 2-3 weeks the ring will be made and the estimated time of delivery which was Feb 6th-19th. Then the store owner messaged him on Feb 19th pretty much saying that they have to mark the order as “shipped” (even though it wasn’t shipped yet) just so Etsy wouldn’t “punish” them. Then they proceeded to send the order finally on Feb 26th. 

My question is, could we go through Etsy to ask for help with this? My husband ordered ahead of time January 19th in order for me to get the ring while I was visiting him in time for our wedding.

627,Etsy,"Just received my first one star from none other than a buyer I got through off-site ads.

Now I don't mean this will be all off-site ad buyers but this it was worth noting as I've seen that you get slightly different buyers through it.

As soon as she purchased I was instantly bombarded with messages asking when the item would be done etc. It's a while before I reply, I'm in the UK and the buyer is US, so there was a time difference. But I politely reply when I can explaining I'd have the item finished by the end of the week (in line with my displayed turnaround) and shortly receive an ""ok thnx"", fine no problems yet.

Over the next few days I receive multiple messages asking specifics about the item (after having purchased), if it is finished yet and what day it will arrive on. I answer them all over the days and try my best to answer the last one considering I'm not the postal service.

I admittedly decide to get the item done a little quicker so I will stop receiving messages and ship the item out. Now in the UK I use royal mail standard international, which doesn't give tracking. I do this as tracking is an extra £2 and I thought it best to keep costs down for international buyers plus I've never had a problem and they generally arrive in reasonable time (keep in mind my items are only £6-20 and she'd purchased one £6 item).
After 3 days I get a message asking where the item is and to provide her with tracking. I explain that there isn't tracking but provide her with the confirmation number and a screenshot to prove it's been sent, and again recieving an ""ok thnx"".

Another 3 days pass and I get a message claiming the tracking number doesnt work, she hasn't received the item and if I can check where the item is. Obviously I cannot check where it is and I explain again that it wasn't a tracking number as I'd made clear before. ""Ok thnx"".
Fast forward to today (a week later) and I've seen I've got my first 1 star review claiming she never received the item and I'd given her a fake tracking number, but she ""wishes she could rate me higher"" -_-

Now not the worst experience out there but I'll be honest it just sucks, especially to have that amongst my other quite glowing reviews. Even more considering after all her messaging she just didn't message when it actually mattered and jumped to a negative review :(

I guess it's partially my fault for not sending on the more expensive tracked option to all international buyers but I don't think they'd pay the extra cost on a £6 item.

Recently, I noticed that the colors on the magnets (all three!) are completely faded and the edges of the design are lifting off the actual magnet. If it was just one magnet, I would assume it was a fluke, but the fact that it happened to all of them is frustrating and annoying. I left a review stating this and the seller messaged me, clearly upset, stating that they believe their products are up to standard and they’ve never had any problems like this. I have a hard time believing that because, again, it happened to all three magnets I ordered.

634,Etsy,"I've been an Etsy seller (amongst other things) for over ten years now and I can unequivocally say that the most annoying part of it is the people! (Only the 20% of people that cause most of the trouble, of course.)

So, I've developed strategies to deal with the headache caused by the 20%; whether it's from being too needy, rude, impossible to please, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

Strategy #1 - Who Cares?!

Yes, it's your shop, your baby and you put pride into your work... but if someone doesn't see it the same way you do, or has given you a bad review. F\*\*\* 'em!

Strategy #2 - Responses

It's hard for many people to come across as polite or non-needy in writing, so it's best to respond to everyone in the most polite manner that you can muster. Oftentimes, someone whom you thought was impolite/needy/demanding in their first message will turn out not to be that way after your reply.

Make sure that you greet your customers by name, acknowledge their reason for enquiry, reassure them, explain something to them, thank them (my favourite is to thank them in advance for their ""patience and understanding"") and wish them a great day/week/weekend in closing! Don't expect a reply back, either, but know that they read your message.

Lots of customers simply want to know that the seller is around, so even a short reply is better than no reply....

... which brings us back to the 20%. If they really are being unreasonable, there is no reason to reply to their constant or threatening/rude messages right away... give it a day, or two, or three...

Strategy #3 - Let Them Eat Case

Yes, case not cake! If you unfortunately encounter the 20% of the 20%, they'll open a case on your a\*\* and you might be concerned or worried. Don't be! The worst that can happen is that you have to provide a full refund (and you've already sent out your item, so you lose that, too).

If someone opens a case against you, you can still be polite, but there is now absolutely no reason to try to please them. If this person was going to be able to work something out with you, they wouldn't have opened a case.

If someone leaves you a bad review without even contacting you about a resolution, well, they've basically said that they accept whatever and are closed to negotiations. You should be closed, as well. Respond politely to their negative review and never think about it again.

&amp;#x200B;

Well, that's all I have off the top of my head right now... we would love to hear your strategies for dealing with the 20%!PSA: 80% of your troubles are caused by 20% of customers"
635,Etsy,"I’m a vintage seller on Etsy, and I always purchase my labels through Etsy. I’ve never had an item break, so I was devastated when I found out that an item arrived broken. I immediately refunded the buyer and asked for photos of the item, the box, etc.

The item cost $85 (without shipping), and I’ve been sitting here trying to figure out how to file a claim for the insurance. Lo and behold, I don’t have an option to file a claim.

Thinking back, when purchasing the label, it states that each label comes with $100 of insurance. I thought that meant the items were automatically insured for up to $100. If I didn’t fill out that insurance field (which I thought was for additional insurance), am I just out of luck and out $85?

639,Etsy,"Hi,
I’m looking to open an etsy shop soon, (or depop, depending on what may work best) however I am unsure if I need to start two separate shops due to the diversity of my items.

I’m planning to sell mostly sewn + felted things: dolls, arm warmers, hair clips, tops, cat toys, and hats. Which I figure could maybe fit into a niche in itself due to the fact that they are sewn/felted creations? However I would also love to sell insect taxidermy shadowboxes, but I’m not sure if I should dedicate a separate shop to that. 

My overall theme is going to be fairytale/whimsical/emporium-ish so I wonder if it would be okay to just fit it into one shop if I stick to that overall theme? My target buyer would be someone who has a love for fairy-like things and oddities.Two Shops or One? Niche vs. Various Items"

She insists she’s already paid but I’m clueless what to do if I don’t have an order from her. I can’t tell if this is some scam to get me to refund the order or if Etsy is just playing up but just seems weird all round. Anyone else ever got a message like this?

642,Etsy,"So I sell one item/product on my store, and it has the weight and dimensions on the item description, yet when I get my orders, everything is zeroed out.  This is extremely cumbersome having to add weight individually to 40 orders when they are all the same thing.

I have tried re-entering and saving, no change. I have tried added a shipping profile and saving that, deleting that, saving, etc. No changes.  I charge flat rate shipping costs on my items (as some times having an extra 50 cents above actual costs of postage allows me to cover packaging costs).  I've been told (incorrectly) by the etsy official forum users that it only auto populates on calculated shipping items.

So i know about the importance of long tail keywords and the higher conversion rate, also the chance being listed in smaller searches.

Of course the product is gonna come up on the search for ""nice braclet"".

But is it being listed in the searches ""nice"" and ""braclet"" just like if I had used two tags? Tag 1 = ""Nice"" Tag 2 = ""Braclet""

The second shop emailed me on the expected delivery date to ask how I liked the items, too. Again, the items hadn't even been delivered. I understand how important it is to receive reviews, but it was irritating to receive these messages. Etsy already badgers buyers to leave reviews, and getting messages asking for feedback before I've even received the items feels spammy and desperate to me. I never email buyers to ask for feedback.

652,Etsy,"Hey guys!

So here's the deal. We make custom made items - individuals order our item, send in what they want made and we design and produce it, in short.

The listing had examples from my customers in the form of collages as the listing photos.

The 7th picture showed a design I made of a popular anime character  that was requested in an order a while back. The anime character design was not mentioned in the listing, was not in the tags and I am not interested in selling it as a product itself, I just was showing some of my work.

This picture resulted in a copyright infringement notice and the listing being taken down.

Okay, yes, I understand the grounds of the notice. I can remove the photo since I am not selling that product, it was just an example of my work.

My question is this - **is the listing like, blacklisted or something now?** Do i have to ask the copyright holder to accept revisions or do I just enable it to be visible again and move on?

The listing has absolutely nothing that could be copyright struck now but Im concerned that relisting it without permission would get me in trouble.

I reached out to etsy and they sent back a copy and pasted email that said that they cant get involved in copyright matters. 

This custom design listing is by far my most popular item, its flagged as the best seller in its category and has about $25-30K in sales. 

 Its purely for custom designs provided from the buyer.

Have you guys ever re-enabled a listing after it got a copyright strike?Relisting a copyright struck item without flagged content?"
653,Etsy,"I sell customized digital download images, and I'm getting ready to go into my busy season. Up until this point, I have sent customers a proof image on Etsy messages, then emailed them the hi-res file after they approve the proof. This is fine when I'm getting only 5-10 orders per day. During my busy season, however, I get upwards of 20-30 orders per day, and it really eats into my time to have to go through and email each customer after they approve their proof. 

I'm wondering if there is a file management solution out there that I can send customers a link to their file and they can download from there, rather than from an email. Basically what I'm looking for is something where I can upload the image, the buyer can approve it or ask for changes, I can make those changes (if needed), and they can download the hi-res from the same link. Ideally this would be something connected to my file management system to eliminate any extra upload steps.

654,Etsy,"I recently saw an Etsy shop with a listing titled ""Tip the Creator"" for $1, so that buyers could add that to their order, or as many of them as they wanted, to tip the shop owner. I just wondered how people feel about this? Is it allowed? Does it go against Etsy's policies?

Just curious really, I've been selling on Etsy for about a year now and have over 1600 sales, and the thought of getting a tip on some of those would have been amazing haha! But a part of me also feels weird about it... hmm....

655,Etsy,"As an Etsy shop owner, I made a lot of rookie mistakes when I first started and boy do I wish someone told me. So here's a list of things you should do to make sure your shop is set up for success!

1. Take good pictures: I literally cannot stress this enough! This is the only way your customers get to see the product before paying for it, they don't get to hold it in their hand or anything so it has to be well represented. Get good lighting, a cute background (you should even show it in use so your customers get a feel for how it would look when they put it on their items) and a good camera (your phone camera, depending on the quality of course, can be good if you're just starting out.)
2. Fill out the description: With EVERYTHING! Explain the product to your customers as if they can't even see pictures of it. Use this space to share a little background (keep it short and simple), material, size, and anything you can that would cross your customers mind. If you receive a lot of questions asking the same thing, be sure to add it to the description.

\*TIP: If you used any props for your photos, be sure to let them know that props are not included in the purchase. It is for demonstration only and is the sale for only the item. You'd be surprised how many people think the props are included.

Also, be sure to mention that colors may vary from screen to screen. Blue on your screen might not look the same on your screen which might not look the exact same in real life. You try to show true representation in your pictures, but cannot control other people's screens.

3. Use all tags: You got 13 of them. USE THEM ALL. Every tag is an opportunity to show up in a         search so not using all of them can miss out on a lot of potential sales. Long-tail keywords are preferred here for best results.

4. Your shop appearance: Your logo, your about, your announcements, your policies, your featured listings, everything should be filled out. It'll show your customers that you're serious about your shop and give off a great first impression. Plus, people buy with emotions. They want to know why or how you created something, it's human nature.

Does anyone in the EU have any experience with shipping to the UK since post Brexit? Mostly in regards to possibly having to obtain an EORI number?

Nowhere in Etsy or Packlink i.e. filling out the customs form, does anybody mention or ask for such a number. However, when recently emailing with a supplier of mine based in the UK, they said everybody sending in and out of the UK has to have an EORI number..

674,Etsy,"I have a fairly large Etsy shop with over 43,000 sales but I am just now encountering a problem that I literally have no idea how to handle. I have had a few customers contact me over the past few days regarding their packages being significantly delayed. When I tracked both of them, it appears they made it from my local USPS to the Distribution Center and then NOTHING.  No updates at all after that. These were both shipped out on February 15th, with the last scan being February 16th. I informed the customers that I was looking into it and if there hasn’t been tracking updated by Monday evening, I will issue a replacement order. 

BUT THEN..... I looked into all of my orders that shipped that same day (approximately 120 orders), and I found that 24 of my orders from that shipment all have the same problem. They were all shipped to two different Distribution Centers and then no updates since February 16th. This prompted me to print out all of my shipping receipts and March directly into my local USPS (and bring out my inner ‘Karen’).  The USPS agent was actually very nice but had no idea as to why so many were being held up. Then I looked at my orders that were shipped out on February 18th, and over 50 of those orders are also held up. I also then looked at my orders that shipped out on Feb 22nd and the same thing.... many orders being completely held up with no updates in the tracking. 

I just don’t understand why. There are many First Class Mail packages and many Priority Mail packages.  Also, these include flat rate envelopes as well as boxes. I have been in business for 3 years and have never changed my shipping process. I know my labels and postage are correct. 

I explained to my USPS agent that this is thousands of dollars worth of product and postage, and if I get a bad review for all of these orders, it will literally put me completely out of business. To say that I am completely besides myself and pulling out my hair is an understatement. I have absolutely no idea what to do now or what to tell my customers who have been waiting 2 weeks for their orders, at no fault of mine or their own. 

Can anyone please provide some advice?

676,Etsy,"Hi there

A customer reached out to me over the weekend as her tracking number hadn’t updated since Feb 4. I directed her to USPS mail help page where she submitted an inquiry. She got a response today (and sent me the screenshot) that the carrier was robbed so the package is lost. USPS suggested she ask “the sender for a replacement”

I’m not sure how to respond. I honestly don’t mind sending a replacement for free but I’m not sure if she should file a claim with Etsy or anything first? 

Anyone have this issue before? The tracking number just says “awaiting delivery scan” and there’s an alert on itEtsy customer had packaged stolen prior to delivery"
677,Etsy,"Hi! So I run a relatively established shop, doing maybe 15-20 orders a day. For the first two years I was crazy excited everytime I got an order, and while it still occasionally blows my mind, I often feel anxious about not being able to be there for all my customers (over the course of a week, I end up having to please and keep track of at least hundred new faces).The packing process has slowly become a dread because of this anxiety (it also does become repetitive once you've done it over three thousand times).

I don't want to sound ungrateful (there's truly nothing I'm more passionate about/care about) and I recognize that in order to continue to create, I need to accept that there are points with relatively menial tasks, but the performance anxiety is really building and making this tough. Has anyone else gone through this?

Also to note, it's hard for me to hire anyone because I live and grew up in a very expensive city, so my current volume is only enough to keep myself afloat.How do I not get tired of packing"

679,Etsy,"I purchased several pairs of earrings from a shop on February 5th, and a shipping label was created on the 10th. That's the last I've heard! The estimated delivery date was the 12th, but it's been in pre-transit since the 10th. I reached out to the seller twice on Etsy and twice on Instagram over the past week but have heard nothing. Her Etsy shop is currently closed, so I got the bounce back message, but she's been somewhat active on Instagram stories, and I DMed her twice. 

Recently she posted that she had some trouble with USPS holding orders and not shipping them so I reached out to inquire if mine was one, but again, have heard nothing. From the very recent reviews, it seems that several people are having the same problem as me-- ordered nearly a month ago, have reached out with no contact so it does seem to be a larger issue.

I've never had any trouble with an Etsy seller before, so I've never had to open a case, but I am getting concerned with the lack of communication. I want to give the benefit of the doubt, because the shop has made many sales, and I'd be more than willing to wait if I could know for sure that my order was one that was affected by the USPS issue. I guess basically I'm wondering if it's an appropriate time to open a case, or if I should hold out a little longer.

684,Etsy,"I keep reading very conflicting material regarding quotes and legality, specifically **very** short quotes. Some say you can sell stuff with **very** short quotes as long as you don't have the brand in your tags (not so you don't get caught, but so you're not profiting off their name), some say don't ever sell anything with a single word from a quote on it, etc.

I feel like what's *technically* legal and what will get you a copyright strike on Etsy may differ. I may not be breaking any laws (or maybe I am), but do I have millions of dollars to fight off Warner Bros if they decide to be heavy-handed? Nope. So I'm a little wary of the legal articles saying it's fine. I have had multiple listings removed by Etsy in the past for really frivolous things, and I countered them all successfully, but those were from other small shops trying to shut down competition.

That said, would I be able to, say, sell a pendant that says ""always"" and nothing else if I don't mention Harry Potter or Harry Potter characters anywhere (including my tags)? You can't copyright a single word. Right? It is obvious where it's from, though.

What about something SIMILAR to a short existing quote (\~3-5 words), but not quite the same, with a few words altered and no names? I'm asking this because I thought of a neat phrase to put on a pin, and when I looked it up, something similar did come up.

What's the general verdict on this stuff right now? I've done a few searches, but most of the ""quote"" stuff that came up was related to prices, or old information, or regarding longer quotes... I'm wondering if even quotes with a **single word** are allowed.Selling stuff with quotes on them"

1. Should I have received any previous emails to change/remove the listings? If so, why didn't I? I just got ""Final notice""...

I have a registered business (I live in France) and my business model is called ""individual"" so I chose that (my mistake, I thought it was correct). So that was my only guess as to it being incorrect. So typed in all of my information, triple checking everything then hit 'send'. A message popped up saying ""unable to update information, try again later' 😑 so I hit send again and this time another (scary and red) message popped up saying ""you've attempted this too many times. Your tax information is incorrect.. blah blah.. Your account may be suspended"". When I was updating my information I had opened the same page in a different tab so I can see the previous information that I had. I don't know if this caused the glitch.

Ok.. so I refresh the page and all of my old (incorrect) information is there!! I don't know what happened with this glitch but I'm seriously freaking out. I have sent a message to etsy support but I'm scared they will suspend me before reading it.

I’m just confused because the weight will change when packaged, and they don’t say the “(when packed)” for the weight part, only for the size/dimensions do they say that.

Is it really that big of a deal?

Is the shipping prices that different if you get the dimensions/weight a bit off?

700,Etsy,"Hellllo, I've tried looking this up online and even through the Etsy help centre but I've not gotten anywhere, so I hope someone can help. **It's a two part query really and the second part is the most important.**

I just don't really understand the basket features.

**Part 1** \--

People on the Etsy forum say that anyone who adds an item to their basket will accumulate and when you hit a threshold, Etsy will add a line to your listing to say, 'Over 20 people have this in their basket' (for example). Apparently an item in a basket is held for 30 days before emptying automatically.

But this can't be true. This caption comes and goes almost randomly on my listings. My most popular product always has the most baskets, so there must be some accurate calculation involved, but sometimes it just disappears completely. It's unlikely the 30-day period of all 20+ baskets expires on the same day. I also have products that say, '10 people have this in their basket' or '3 people...' so even if some *do* expire, why does the caption all but disappear and not just lower the number?

**Part 2** \--

The second and most important part of my query is that *if this is the case*, what constitutes an 'Abandoned basket'? Because I've had a coupon set up for over 2 years to offer any abandoned baskets 15% off, but according to my account it has only ever emailed out 1 email with this coupon. I get the 'Over 20 people...' thing all the time, so if it clears, people must be abandoning their baskets...?

Why then is Etsy not offering the coupon?How do baskets and abandoned baskets work? [2 queries]"

I waited until the end of January with no word and ended up reaching out to see if there were any updates, seller then proceeded to tell me that they would be going out first week of January, as they just found a supplier to print the item. That wasn't a problem for me at all. 

The seller ended up including in my update that they had stated in the kickstarter that there would be additional shipping tacked on and they had listed shipping as free on Etsy because that was the only way the site actually promotes an item.

This was a bit frustrating to me, as I put the item on my credit card and planned for a specific price point. I told them this and that I wasn't really sure what they expected me to do as the item was listed as free shipping. They told me that they would be shipping out the item and I could pay it back whenever. 

The item shipped out today, two months past when I paid for it and I have an email asking for shipping to be sent to venmo or cash app. 

I feel bad because the item was already in the process of being made when they informed me of the shipping, they were made to order items. I didn't fund it on kickstarter, I purchased it on etsy with shipping included. The store said they would have loved to cover the cost but they wouldn't make any money that way so I'm torn on what to do.

Should I find something to sell to make up the shipment or am I in the right that they had free shipping and I don't need to send the 16 more dollars? Money is tight at the moment and I budgeted for the price of the item specifically.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated 😞Seller wants shipping after purchase because it was stated in a Kickstarter?"

The product I’m selling on Etsy isn’t groundbreaking, and even though I was the only shop selling them when I first started last year, I kinda knew that it’s only a matter of time that other sellers would start popping up.

So yes - a few months later, shops selling similar products started appearing. I know I can’t control the actual product itself, but there was a couple shops with very similar photography style which was annoying. It’s not exactly plagiarism, so I couldn’t technically do anything.

Then a few weeks ago I found one who literally copied and pasted my description into their own, using the same exact sentences and format to describe the product. They changed literally only a few words here and there, but the rest is an exact replica. I know that it’s just words and it’s nothing compared to people plagiarizing art and stuff, but reading my own voice and language on another person’s listing is just weird.

So I contacted them really nicely, saying, “hey I noticed that bla bla bla... Imitation is the best flattery and I appreciate you taking inspiration from my listing, but it's very clear that some of your descriptions have been literally copied and pasted (with a little modification) from my listing. My work is not like any other amazing artwork here that needs legal copyright protection, but outright and direct copying has never sat right with me. As a fellow Etsy seller, I am respectfully asking you to honor each other's work, originality, and uniqueness, because this community is only possible through all of those things. I hope that you will find the time to craft something new and original, which can start from your listing description. We are more creative than we think :)”

They responded, “I took language and directions from [the internet]. We are selling the same products so our language will be similar.”

Me: *Proceeded to take screenshots and annotated all the exact wording in red. Also, at this point I just realized that, this person was a PREVIOUS buyer who gave me 5-star review and offered to ‘promote’ my shop on their Instagram page*

Them: “Again, we are both selling the same products. The language will have similarities. I cannot change the the properties of [product] or the benefits of using [product]. If you watch any videos or read articles, the language used is similar. This can be found across the internet. I use the same language in my posts on social media. The Language is common. I did not copy your text.”

Me: “I'm not talking about similar language. I'm talking about exact, word-by-word, copy-and-paste. Yes, I do watch and read articles, but find me another source in the internet that uses these exact wordings but my listings. *(gave more examples of the exact same sentences and format)*

I tried to be nice, but it's almost insulting that you wouldn't at least admit that you took some inspiration from my listing. I can't believe you used to offer to advertise my shop on your Instagram if I were to have an IG account for this shop, and now you've decided to just completely stole everything.

I will take the high road and end this here. I hope you think twice the next time you're copying someone, as much as you don't want to admit it. Have a good one.”


They didn’t respond, but a couple hours later I noticed them change their description. Still not completely original, but it’s a step.


I guess I’m just bummed at people like this who wouldn’t even admit their mistakes. And if this is what I went through with words, I can’t imagine what it’d be like with more ‘expert’ copycats who steal people’s artworks, technology, brands, etc. Seeing other shops selling similar products to mine has forced me to innovate and diversify my product line, which is beneficial for me and the bigger market, but copycats are just annoying as hell and I just wanted to let off some steam.

I know on Etsy that there are Sellers who are able to print pictures on plush fleece blankets. My grandpa passed away right before the pandemic in January 2020 and my grandma passed away a couple weeks ago, February 15, 2021, due to COVID. 

My aunt and mom has been taking my grandma’s passing really hard since they tried their best to keep her safe from the virus.. Unfortunately the virus found its way to my grandma and caused pneumonia in her lungs. She fought hard until the end and I believe that my grandpa told her to let go so  that he can be with her again &lt;3

Well, to get to my point, I am looking for a Seller that can print a a single photo of my grand parents in their prime years and send it out to two different addresses; SeaTac, WA and Longview, WA. I am not sure if that is an option on Etsy.

I think I can do it on Shutterfly, but I would rather support an Etsy Seller for this project because I know the quality will be made with care rather than a bigger business just taking orders, if that makes sense.

714,Etsy,"Hi all,

I was notified by a paralegal at a law firm that I was selling something that involved a copyright infringement.  While I don't understand how it violates the copyright, I of course took the listing down immediately while looking into it.  I certainly never want to violate someone's rights!  Here is the info, that I was sent...

""Our client has not authorized you to use the phrase “Christmas Forget the Milk and Cookies got Wine?”, which is confusingly similar to the “got milk?” trademark and tarnishes the “got milk?” brand. Specifically, it is apparent here that you intended to capitalize on the good will created by our client’s world famous “got milk?” marks by using the phrase in a slightly manipulated manner to which is insufficient to eliminate the likelihood of confusion. Further, even if this product does not create any confusion about its source or affiliation with our client’s “got milk?” marks, our client is protected from trademark dilution by tarnishment. Here, you use a twist on our client’s famous mark to discourage the consumption of milk, the very reason the brand was created, and instead to encourage the consumption of alcohol. This is an attempt to tarnish our client’s famous “got milk?” marks for you and your company to make a profit.""

While, I don't entirely agree, it is probably better to just leave it unlisted and move on.  Just not worth it.

However, as in everything you make your own decisions about what to do with your own product listings, I am just sharing the information.Copyright infringement? ""Got Milk"""
715,Etsy,"I have a few questions i want to be certain about.

1. From etsy guidelines of which type of websites are prohibited from being an affiliate program: 
""Sites that exist solely or predominately to promote Etsy items""

Okay, i get it. There must be value. But then i look at obvious affiliate sites such as www.thisiswhyimbroke.com, and i wonder: doesnt these guys do exactly that? Or are they let off the hook because of the other products listed (Amazon is one of their affiliate), if not just for them being popular and driving good amounts of traffic. Yes, they write short descriptive texts - but is that really enough to bypass this rule? Because i am interested in doing likewise in another niche, not only with affiliate products, and i dont want to get shut down immediately.

719,Etsy,"I signed up as an Etsy seller on 2/19/21 to sell my landscape portraits after many friends suggested it. I have enjoyed shopping on Etsy so I thought I would give it a shot and hopefully have a much needed additional income. I worked long hours trying to set up my store and make my listings. At roughly 6 p.m. on 2/23/21 I was publishing a listing when I got a notification that something went ""wrong"". I kept trying and kept getting the same notice. I thought I needed to refresh my computer so I logged out, closed my browser and tried to log back in but I got the message that the Etsy account associated with my email had been deactivated and closed. I got on the customer service chat and after some helpful messages back and forth the CSR said after further review my account had been closed and I was banned from ever selling on Etsy again and to kindly respect the decision and not to contact them again and he ended the chat. I called the CS line and was basically told the same thing by the kind lady who took my call. She said Etsy limited the info on accounts as to what they were allowed to see and all she could tell me was that my account was banned and I would not be allowed to sell on Etsy ever. I am completely perplexed as to why this happened. I tried emailing but I have got no response. Why would my account suddenly be banned. I hadn't even made one sale and my landscape photos are beautiful. Please help and at least give me a reason. Thank you.My Etsy Seller Account was deactivated and deleted with no notice or reason given"
720,Etsy,"So I just sold my first item and now I’m panicking because when I set up the listing I selected Etsy shipping, but now that the time has come to send out the item, what do I do? Will the post office know?How does etsy shipping work?"
721,Etsy,"Greetings, 

I work as a personal shopper sometimes. I bought from a seller in the USA some Kyara agarwood chips (0.5 gram tiny jar), and gave him the address of my customer so he can send it to him. I choose the fastest shipping and asked him to confirm it was the fastest because the customer needs it ASAP. He then confirmed it the fastest, and will be shipped through DHL.

 

So, what's the issue you say? He took almost a week to even prepare a shipping label for this expedited shipping service. And he only issued the shipping label after I sent him a friendly message asking him that I want to cancel the order because my customer backed out on me, and can't pay me back because of the recent weather consequences on him and his family. He ignored my message completely, and issued a shipping label after three hours to cover himself, then took three days just to hand DHL the package.

 

The item itself as he mentioned in the details, already comes cut from his Japanese source, and he further cut them and put them in two tiny jar sizes for long storage times. So, it's not a matter of special personalised item. It's already cut and prepared in advance. Also, I learned later that he charges five times the amount compared to the other sellers on Etsy for the same product which is always in demand. So that tells a little something about him. 

 

The customer told me he received the package, and will send it back to the seller. I know the fault lies with me in part of this, but I trusted my customer, and thought the seller had some compassion too. So how can I proceed now? Thanks.

 

Tl;dr : I bought a non personalised item for someone. He told me he couldn't pay me back for it because of special circumstances. I asked the seller to cancel. He ignored me and immediately issued a shipping label. The seller is in the USA, the item was sent to a German customer in Germany.Seller refuses to refund and to accept a return.."

724,Etsy,"I got a message from a UK magazine offering me some generic praise and asking if I would like to advertise with them in print/e media (although one must pay the print price to get to pay to advertise electronically).  The magazine name, employee name, and address check out but I’m hardly a large seller, I’m based in the US, and as a handmade seller of not-too-pricy goods I can’t imagine this would be worthwhile as advertising for me.

However it did make me curious about whether this is a scam or if print mags are just that desperate to get businesses to advertise that they are down to asking Etsy sellers with 100 sales to shell out $500 for a month’s advertising?Are print magazines desperate, or is there a new scam going on?"
725,Etsy,"Okay so I'm a witchy person, and I thought it would be a good idea to buy skulls on Etsy. I'm a seller as well so I didn't really want to make a big deal out of this situation, but now that I'm thinking about it.... It's really gross.
I didn't see the bugs in the skull until I put it into my terrarium, and left it for a few days. They're a type of larva that eats meat specifically used in taxidermy, and with help from a taxidermist on another subreddit, they suggested to leave a bad review, because the skull obviously still had meat and fat still on it. Yuck. 
I did tell the seller about the bugs, and she said it would be ok, that the bugs will die off but I can put the skull in water so the bugs will die, just to be safe. The other subreddit explained that the larvae will burrow into ANYTHING, including carpet, books, and everything else pretty much. Yuck yuck yuck.
I really don't know what I should do. The vegan in me just wants to put the skull outside and forget about it, but I should at the very least change my initial 5star, glowing review, right?

TL;DR: i bought an animal skull with bugs in it. What would you do in my situation?Was sold an animal skull with 'meat' still on it... And bugs."

“fast delivery. Cute top. But I can’t give it 5 stars since it looks different from the shirt pictured but I know it should look different every time”

I've been having problems receiving my items. I believe the seller is sending it with no tracking number with just a forever stamp. Seller is in Michigan and I am in California. I was wondering what the approximate delivery time has been for you guys for a distance like this, considering weather conditions right now?

733,Etsy,"I sell printable journals.  The main idea is that you print a little book with prompts in it and you get to write in it and GROW as a person. Well, they're not selling too well on Etsy, so I thought I would get some professionally printed and go out to pet stores and try to get them to carry my pet-related one. And go out to bars and try to get them to give away my beer flight one for free.  (Don't ask how you can grow as a person by writing about a beer flight.  Trust me! It all depends where you're starting out.) Which I would be giving them for free.

I have been in these types of places countless times. I know what is like to walk into a pet food store or a bar!  But when you walk in, preparing to sell something... it's a totally different experience.   The bartender is not your friend! She is . . . Scary.  The eye makeup I would have thought was kinda cool, if a bit heavily applied - now just increased the ferocious intensity of her glare.  The ridiculous top, obviously selected for its ability to make the inebriated male patron forget the difference between paying his tab and giving her all the leafy green papers in his wallet, shimmered threateningly.  ""We already have something like that"" she growled as she turned away. 

""No you don't!"" I wanted to say.  "" I've eaten here before.""

But did I? No! I got the message. I left - salespeople are not wanted here! I felt ugly and uncool.

I’ve been wanting to purchase a rug from Morocco from Etsy. (I live in the US)

However, i have no idea how to navigate paying duties? How to not get it held up in customs? How expensive the import will be (I’ve done multiple calculators and some say it will cost nothing bc it’s under 800 US dollars. And some say I will owe upward of 500 dollars for import)

I can’t find any clear info about how I deal with this stuff. It’s all very convoluted. 

Does anyone have an experience about importing into the US. 

DO I EVEN NEED TO DO ANYTHING? will it just magically arrive?

WORST part? The buyer, knowing they were ordering last minute, had it sent to the location they were traveling to, which actually gave the order an extra 3 days to arrive. When it didn't, she was there for a few days, so later was good too. So, even a very very late delivery, would still have been totally fine (she just needed it to be there). I am devastated that it didn't arrive in time, but am so relieved to be working with one of the kindest buyers I have ever had. 

I refunded, she reordered, and all is good on that end.

So I’ve been on Etsy since November and I was selling just sticker packs until recently when I started making 420 friendly resin art too.

Recently I’ve had a massive influx of customers saying they didn’t get their orders but other people who were sent out with those letters have had theirs weeks before? 
Like I get one or two that get lost in post I’m not worried about those but like 5-10 is a joke right?

But then I noticed that my shop now showed 4.5 stars filled. As an Etsy customer myself, I know this is not good for bringing new customers, many have a full five stars to brag. I messaged the person right after they reviewed asking them anything I can do to improve their experience and have yet to receive a reply. I'm so bummed that someone would do that to a new shop... They could at least say what was wrong! Now all I can hope for is that my other customers bring the score up to five.

I bought an item from Israel back in November of 2020 (Black Friday Weekend) which had been shipped on December 2nd, 2020. I received a tracking number and waited for the estimated arrival time which was between late December and early January. I had received one tracking update for the whole time.

So on January 05, 2021 my order was re-shipped under the new number and the last update I have is from January 10, 2021 saying that it was 'Sent to Canada'. There are no 'Estimated Arrival Dates' in any websites.

773,Etsy,"Hello everyone,

I have had an etsy store for several years now, as a part-time thing. Recently I encountered this strange situation, and I was wondering if anyone has ever experienced something similar, or has   
any advice on how to handle it.

So- right when I first started my etsy I made a custom-made item for a customer which was very intricate and for which, in hindsight, I was probably underpaid. Recently that same customer messaged me a picture of this item, and asked if I could make him something similar. He had apparently forgotten that I was the person who originally made him that item. I replied, explaining that I had made it, and asking why he wanted another copy of it.

He then seemed to remember me, and explained that he had gifted the original item to a friend, and now regretted it. Finding this kind of strange, I googled his name and soon found a website selling many items in the same category as mine (I'm trying to be vague), where mine was also listed as 'SOLD'. He had sold my item for 4x the amount I charged, and I suspect he was planning to do this again. I replied with a link to the website, asking if he re-sold my item and expressing that I felt uncomfortable about him doing so without being honest about it, and never got a proper reply. 

Does anyone know if this goes against Etsy's policies? I feel uncomfortable about the whole situation (especially the dishonesty), but I'm not sure if this is actually abnormal

Thanks!Customer re-sold an item bought from me"

Would it be better to start off the first year as a hobby to ""see how it goes"" before doing all the paperwork that small business entails? Or would it be better to do small business first so that I have more tax write offs?

Im new to Etsy and I wonder if it feel correct and appropriate to bargain with seller about a price? 
I found some used jacket I like, but it's quite expensive and I'm thinking if I should try and ask seller if he could make a price a bit cheaper. 
Something like: ""I'm sorry if you'll find it inappropriate, but may I ask if price could be discussed a little bit?""
This item was placed last November, so maybe the seller will be glad to offer like 10 % discount on it and sell it at last. But I don't want to be impolite, so any advice much appreciated.

I bought a one of a kind item for my husband; it was intended to be for Valentine’s Day, but with shipping I knew it wouldn’t arrive on time. I ordered it January 28th, and the item description and shipping tab indicated it would arrive by February 6th. Awesome!

“Hello!

No, I can't use the Variations as they limit you to 2 and I required 3-5 measurements, depending on the item.

I honestly don’t mind either way, but was curious if people would be more apt to buy just 1 wire hair wrap, or if they’d prefer a pack (because I mean they are a bit on the smaller side!) 

I would think people prefer packs, because you tend you want to decorate your hair with more then 1 accessory piece. 

But, I’m new to Etsy so I’m not sure whether people there prefer to buy multiples or singles of a hair accessory.

Feedback is welcomed(:Selling in singles or selling in packs?"
817,Etsy,"Ok so let me explain. I have my shop setup to encourage the buyer to purchase multiple items. I do this by offering all of my buyers free shipping on orders over $40 CAD or if they purchase any 2 items in my shop. The shipping cost does not change for me or changes very little because my items do not weigh very much so it is much more cost effective to encourage them to buy more.

My dilemma is this: Over half of my shoppers qualify for free shipping but I also send the majority of my parcels with untracked air parcel. With the way the world is currently working I would love if everyone chose to upgrade their shipping to tracked parcel. Of course I offer upgraded shipping but it only offers it to my customers at the full price without factoring in the free shipping discount I already have in place if they qualify for free shipping.

For example, I charge a flat rate of $10 on all orders under $40. Buyer A buys an order worth $20 and Buyer B buys $40 worth of product. Buyer A and B both will get my standard shipping option but Buyer A will pay $10 in shipping while Buyer B received it for free. 

I also offer tracked, express shipping for a flat rate of $18. Both customers have the option to upgrade to my tracked method but Buyer A has the option to upgrade for only $8 more than they are already paying for postage but as Etsy currently has their system setup Buyer B needs to pay the full $18 to upgrade.

Is there a way to offer Buyer B the option to upgrade their shipping while factoring in my free shipping and only charging them $8 more?

I hope this makes senseOffer discounted upgraded shipping to encourage buyers to pick it?"
818,Etsy,"I'm working on a new listing and looking for some advice. The item in question will be a layered, paper pieced artwork and I'd like to have the option to sell it unframed or framed.

Unframed it can be shipped in a flat rigid mailer for a fairly decent shipping price. However framed in a shadowbox, it will need to be packed/shipped in a box as a parcel and the shipping will obviously be higher.

My question is: is there any way to have 2 shipping profiles for one listing? I know I can do the variations for the framed and unframed options, but both options are using single shipping info provided so either the shipping cost will be too high for unframed or too low for framed (or vice versa) depending on how I set it up.

If having multiple profiles for 1 listing isn't an option, any advice on how I might set this up?

Would it make more sense to just set it as unframed but have a frame as an add-on listing with the appropriate shipping? Or should I just forgo offering a frame and sell it as is with info on the type of frame needed? TIA!Can you have more than 1 shipping profile for a listing?"

I'm at a loss for words. I cannot believe there are people like this. On another note, i received a follow up note from Etsy that said this at the bottom.

I sell on etsy myself, so I know how much importance etsy places on reviews, and how often, reviews are just...illogical.  I'd like some input on how to point out to non experts, this seller is selling diseased plants because, they are just someone flipping plants with zero knowledge most likely (I have no reason to believe they are intentionally dumping damaged/ill stock on people) and how their plants will probably arrived damaged given they have zero concept on how to pack a plant to ship.

Make a move so you don't miss out.""

It was annoying enough to get this box when you're actually shopping. I get WHY they do it: this idea that there's limited stock and omg you should buy it RiGHt NoW so you don't miss out! I've seen it on other sites and found it a teeny bit annoying, but at least the box is a quick ""oop, someone just bought one of these, you should probably hurry up and check out"" and then it's self-eradicating.

They're offering the same readings I am... not my wording or anything copyright-able, but let's say I'm doing a ""Were You A Cat In A Past Life?"" reading... well, she is, too.

Is it against Etsy's terms of service for a competitor to deliberately go after another shop like this?

I go into PayPal and I see that my payment was sent, but was cancelled. I remember a while back I got a random message on PayPal saying that I was refunded as they didn't make a PayPal account to claim the funds.

So from what I can tell they never had a account to claim the money. And obviously it hadn't been sent either. But on etsy I can still leave a review? Since I bought the product there has been 3 one star reviews saying the same thing as what happened with me.

So immediately after I posted this I responded with a big whole long thing with USPS's FAQ, saying I'll submit a missing mail search, it should take 2-3 days etc. If we can't find it I will be happy to send a new one once I hear from the USPS about the status (mind you, the package has already been marked as delivered, as per my previous post).

Got an answer back saying (paraphrased) ""I checked everywhere, this has happened before with other packages, USPS sucks and this always happens. So I need information."" 

They sent me this message at about 10PM my time... I wasn't checking my phone. 

Got another message an hour later with them saying ""they are in the dark without me"" and ""needed to know the information of the package""

I responded soon as I woke up (which is still technically out of my business hours) telling them once again I have submitted the case and gave them all the details of the package (the tracking number, 1st class, etc. WHICH should have auto-filed if they inputted the tracking number into the USPS site... but whatever). Asked them what other information they needed.

Fast forward 4 days, still no call from the USPS but I'm not surprised. It's taken a whole week after first contact for them to call me. Well, buyer left a 1-star review saying ""Never got the item.""

I am SO upset over this. I've done so much to try to help but 1. the buyer hasn't been clear what they need from me and 2. I am literally doing everything I can save just giving them their money back (WHICH I OFFERED TOO, I said ""I can refund you or send a new one once I hear from the USPS, depending on what I find out from them. It just depends on what you want at that time), and they said ""oh yeah it's not your fault"" and then leaves me a 1 star review???

I've reported it to Etsy and this point I'm done. Maybe I'm being an asshole seller but as far as I'm concerned at this point the package was delivered. When I get the call from the USPS I'll figure out what happened to the package and send the buyer the info, but at that point I'm done.

I’m in Montreal, Canada and when deciding on whether to buy boxes or not, I checked the rates for shipping to the US and it was the same price and the bubble mailer (8$) so I bought 100 boxes on uline. 
I get to the post office to mail out my first box to New Brunswick and it ended up costing me 15$. 
I charge $5 shipping in Canada and 7$ shipping in the US, so I took a $10 loss with that sale, but no loss for the US orders.

844,Etsy,"Hey, I run a skateboarding engraving business on Etsy. Recently an order came thru as a gift for her dad. He owns a screen printing business so she wanted to get him something special. 

I have it stated in my description that all of my engravings are done on the top of the board. I kept in contact with her throughout the way- sent her pictures of the final product and she had no issues with it. 
This morning she gave me a 5 star review with a happy picture of her dad with the board.

A couple hours later, her dad messaged me on my facebook telling me that I engraved the wrong side- and being rather blunt and rude. 

I explained that it is stated in my description which side will be engraved AND that I do that for a particular reason (so you can still shred it up). His daughter didn’t tell me that it needed to be placed on the bottom.

This was a fully custom piece, it honestly took me about 40 hours with all of the tedious design, and printing which had major hiccups. 

He is now asking how much it would cost to receive a new “correct” board. He said that he can send the current board back, but I have no use for it. I cant use it, or sell it because it was a custom piece. 
I don’t accept returns or exchanges on custom products- and there isn’t anything wrong with the board other than being on the wrong side. 

I guess I am not sure how to approach this. I sell my custom boards for $100 each- should I offer him a new one at a discounted price? 
Should I just ask he pay shipping and supplies? 
Should I tell him that I just don’t accept returns or exchanges on custom pieces?

I think this could get messy if I go against my shop policies and outside of etsy- but he already seems like he could be very rude if I say no.

845,Etsy,"Hi, I recently was trying to think of different ways of packaging jewelry that i’m going to be making and selling on etsy, and I was wondering out of these two options which sounds better. (each option will have the logo stamped onto the cloth pouches that the jewelry would be going into, and come with a thank you and jewelry care card). also any other ideas or suggestions are welcome. i tried to do a lot of research about this but i am still very new to it :)

Option 1: Small cloth pouch wrapped with kraft paper in a small box, and a wax stamp on top to seal it. and that would go into a small bubble mailer. 

Options 2: The same small cloth pouch but wrapped in kraft paper with wax seal and put that into the bubble mailer. (basically option one but without the box)

i’m not sure which one to do because option 1 would maybe be more protective, but option 2 would cut down on cost and waste of the packaging, and also making the shipping cost slightly less. and i didn’t know if just the pouch and kraft paper itself would be enough because i have seen people do that in videos i have watched while researching. i could maybe even start off with the no box option to save some money when starting out and eventually purchase boxes.Question about what kind of packaging I should have for jewelry."

I thought Canva might be a solution, but have found so many printers complaining about people submitting these and that they are no good for printing so that seems a dead end.

They (printers) also want me to buy far too many bookmarks in one design.

867,Etsy,"The question is often raised: ""why are there so many dropshippers and resellers of Chinese goods on Etsy""?

Based on my supplies shops, I can say this: Etsy buyers conduct less due diligence on price and source than other marketplace buyers (Bonanza, eBay, Amazon). Some of these goods I know are not competitive with sellers on eBay because of the need to price in Offsite Ads Fees, yet they still sell. While some of those buyers may have wanted to purchase from me, I know many arrive via offsite ads and simply buy the first thing they see. I appreciate the sales, but this can be a dangerous game for other types of goods that are ""fake handmade"" items or dropshipped from overseas without any seller involvement. Why is it dangerous to have buyers do this?

\- Etsy's ML models gain more data of the A/B tests which were running when that sale was made. If the description was completely collapsed and there was no title, and a sale was made, Etsy is now likely to present that test to additional users.

\- The sellers of cheap Chinese made goods or dropshippers gain more economic incentive to relist those same items, or list new items. Their items get better search rank by increasing sell-through volume.

So, as an Etsy buyer, you can make Etsy a better marketplace by:

1. Expand the description of the item you wish to purchase
2. Do a reverse image search on your item to verify it is not a resold cheap item. Try using TinEye or searching for the item on AliExpress.
3. Check out the buyer's profile. Is the seller based in the country they are shipping the goods from? Do they have a website?

Etsy has given up trying to police these types of sellers, so by conducting due diligence, you can elevate the real handmade sellers.Etsy buyers have a responsibility to conduct due diligence on the items they are buying"

I clearly cannot compete with that price because I am actually running a proper business and I need to make a profit.

I've had my Etsy store for around 8 months now, and I've just noticed something awry. 

It's not something I've noticed before, so not sure if it's new.

My account balance was £0.00.

I've just sold an item for £6.00.

Auto renew: -£0.14
VAT Auto renew: -£0.03
Transaction Fee: -£0.30
VAT processing fee: -£0.09
VAT transaction fee: £0.06

= -£0.62 

So, my account should be showing balance as £5.38. 

It is, in fact, showing £4.94. 

Where's the missing 44p? 

I've never noticed this before. I've had over 700 sales so if this has been happening the whole time, that's a lot of missing money. 

My account balance was most definitely at zero as I've just had my earnings transfered a couple hours before this order and this is my only order today.

I just bought something from etsy on my profile which is connected to my store. I put the delivery address as my grandmother's name and address as it's for her. However, she has bought items from my store in the past, obviously using the same name and address, and now I'm concerned etsy will shut my store?

887,Etsy,"I’m having problems with a seller that I’ve ordered from before, and I don’t know how to proceed. I’ve ordered at least 9 items from this shop over the years, including 6 dresses this year. I’ve spent over 1,000 USD at this shop this year alone. I love this shop so much, and I think they make unique, well-made,  comfortable and flattering clothes. That’s why I want to come up with a solution that will be mutually satisfactory.

I received 3 dresses in my most recent order, and I’m not happy with two of them. Essentially, the items are not what is pictured in the listing. Both dresses have a similar style: a solid colour with  contrasting fabric around the neck and the bottom of the sleeves. However, both dresses have a huge stripe of the contrasting fabric over “ruching” on the hips. I think it really takes away from the style of the dress. I double checked the pictures (including buyer pics of the item) and none have the extra contrasting fabric on the hips. I’m honestly really puzzled how this happened, because none of their items have this style so it’s not even like it’s a mix up of the order. 

In addition, one of the dresses has a scoop neck and there is an incredibly sloppy seam on one shoulder (think a big hunk of serge fabric twisted and sewed upwards).

I’ve written to the seller, and included picture, as well as screen shots from their listing asking how to proceed... and I haven’t received a response in more than 24 hours.

This is an established shop with 30,000+ sales. Do I open a case? Ideally, I’d like to get these items replaced/fixed, if it could be done quickly. However, it took 4 months (!) to get my order and the dresses have long sleeves so will soon be out of season. I’m also worried that returning them is going to be a huge hassle to get taxes/duty back, because it’s something from the US and I live in Canada. Does anyone have any advice on the best outcome for me might be?

I am also aware that this is a small business and I don’t want to be a difficult customer. However, I’m so disappointed with my order that I’ve been eagerly awaiting for months.

I’d really appreciate any advice you might have.

890,Etsy,"I shipped a sticker to a customer using my standard method of shipping, 1st class letter. The customer contacted me a few days after that and told me they had not received the order yet. I checked my Etsy order page and saw that it was delivered. I figured it must have been misdelivered, asked them to verify their address, they verified, and I promptly shipped a replacement to them. 

Delivery issue seldom happens, so I don't mind sending a replacement. Instead of using USPS 1st class letter, I used USPS 1st class package with a real USPS tracking number.  In my message to them, I apologized and included the link to the replacement's USPS tracking page.

Last week, they placed another order. I checked the replacement order tracking, and it showed delivered, so I assumed that the customer liked it so much they wanted another one. To confirm, though, I sent a message to the customer saying that I saw they placed a new order and if they received their replacement. I didn't receive a reply from the customer, so I thought no news is good news and shipped off the new order using USPS 1st class package the following day.

Today, the customer contacted me saying they have not received any stickers yet and to give them tracking numbers. I again linked both USPS tracking numbers. I explained the replacement's tracking showed that it was delivered to a mailbox. The 2nd order showed in transit, but late so I explained it must be the winter storm causing the delay. I'm currently waiting for the buyer to message me back.

I tried compressing the pdf, but I felt like the quality wasn't the same when I zoomed in.

I have looked around a bit and can't find any scam that matches this setup. Is this familiar to anyone? It seems very fishy, and I'm inclined to say no, get my refund and cut bait. TIA!

UPDATE: Seller has refunded the original amount (confirmed in PP), and is asking me to purchase via a new link from the same Etsy shop. She said the original payment was 'limited' or restricted by PayPal for too many transactions. I have asked her if the new payment will go through via PayPal, and why the watch is now seven dollars less expensive. Another odd detail is there is only one watch in stock, but it is in 10 etsy carts...assuming this is a sales pressure tactic?

UPDATE 2: The seller has removed the link to the watch, but it shows up in the shop as a completed sale. She has not replied since that happened. Hmm... It's possible she is just new at this (only 3 sales total) and is legit struggling. Unfortunately, it can be interpreted as scammy behavior as well. Thank you for the advice so far!

UPDATE 3: The seller removed the link and replied that the watch was sold to someone else. Weird. I got my refund as promised, though, so other than a few wasted minutes, I'm out nothing.

https://www.reddit.com/r/Etsy/comments/ljcm3n/the_order_that_keeps_on_giving/

I wrote this at the weekend.  The back story and history is there.  

It was a scam.  I don't have anything official to tell me it was a scam but I know now it was a scam. 

The I don't know if he engaged with etsy when the case was open.  I don't know if he engaged in the trust and safety process. 

Anyways etsy refunded me and then the seller started sending me messages. I got two and thank goodness no more. 

He claimed he sent the item to me mid week of last week.   Only that he never informed me of that when the case was open.  He left it til the case was closed and refunded.

I bought from an Irish seller and I am in Ireland and so it would have been a national post item. 

Post in Ireland is usually quick 1 to 3 days.  It doesn't usually take long. 

The seller claimed in one of the messages that he sent the item to me mid week of last week.  I would consider mide week to be Wednesday or Thursday.  

There was no parcel from him in the mail to me at any stage sent then - Friday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and today on Thursday.  No mail.   That's 5 working days.  Nothing showed up from him. 

I made other online orders last week and I got other stuff arrive to me in the mail.  Like one order was dispatched on Thursday and delivered to me on Friday.  Another order was dispatched yesterday and delivered to me today. 


Its just after hitting me now that the seller was a scammer.   I had my doubts before now.  I don't get it though. Its so weird and such an elaborate scam because he did have the item for me and he did send it before the Christmas but it was broken.   If all he wanted to do was scam money out of people you would think, he wouldnt have anything to post people.

To better explain, [this](https://i.imgur.com/dExNTeY.png) is what the file looks like. Each outline is a different cut, and each color is on a different layer (for 22 different layers total).

904,Etsy,"I feel like the adjective “reused” for something that is, well, reused, could potentially sound weak, unappealing, a turn off to someone who is buying something handmade.

I LOVE to repurpose things. Mainly because it limits me in a helpful way (being a creative, I have so many ideas that sticking to 1 thing can be challenging), as well as knowing the amount of pollution involved when tossing [still usable] things in the trash.. I just am a pure believer that nothing has just ‘one purpose’. Nothing has purpose until we humans give it a purpose &amp; meaning, so really the amount of purposes are infinite! 

Anyways, what would you recommend be a better term to use instead of “reused” or “repurposed”—Although with “repurposed”, some of the things I use are given the same use, just used differently. Like I’ll take a charm from a necklace and add it to a chain with 20 other charms; still the same use but more so “reused” then “repurposed”.

Or is the term “reused” not a turn off and sounds okay to use?

I also don’t think many people would search the term “reused” because I mean Etsy is a handmade place, not a resell place.Is the term “reused” a turn off to buyers? What could be an alternative word? Recycled? Upcycled? Recovered? Repurposed?"

910,Etsy,"I’ve been hearing a lot recently about sellers being scammed. Customer saying their item had been marked as delivered but they never got it just so they can get their money back and the free item. I am worried that this is happening to me. 

I’m in Canada and I was shipping my handmade oven mitts to the UK. It’s only been in transit for 10 business days and that’s too soon for it to be delivered

The package also goes as letter mail and is untrackable. The customer chooses this option at checkout because the tracked option is considerably higher priced 

The customer opened a case and said they had not received their item. They said that the royal post had messaged them and said that their order had been delivered and signed for. She said she never signed for anything and the package is missing. She even checked around her backyard and her neighbors. (all the standard things scammer scammer would say. I feel bad because I used to think people were honest but they are not so now I see everyone as dishonest until proven otherwise) 

I informed her it’s too early for her package to be delivered and that the royal post would not have contacted her saying it had been delivered because untracked mail doesn’t have a tracking number or need to be signed for. 

She hasn’t responded yet but I just want to make sure that I’m handling the situation as professionally as I can. I also mentioned that she may have been notified for an additional package from another seller that was tracked

I’m just wondering if anyone has any helpful advice so that this doesn’t get out of hand.Advice needed"

913,Etsy,"A buyer made a purchase from me in the first week of January as a gift to a friend (who is located in my city). The buyer's location is in another state. I dispatched everything on time and mind you I have shop banners, announcements, listing photos all stating why postal services are delayed. The order was untracked (I provide shipping upgrades as well). 3 weeks pass by and I get the same order from her, now shipping to her location (untracked). I think ""oh, her friend must've liked the item and now she got it for herself, cool!"". 

A few days after her second order she messages me very rudely saying that she ""thinks"" her friend didn't get the order and its been a month. I immediately get a weird feeling and message to say to check mailboxes and not just porches, etc. etc. She says her friend has checked. I reply to say that this is incredibly rare (in fact, has never happened!) that a package has taken so long to arrive in my city. So, I refund the order amount in full since she has waited so patiently.  I was unable to remake the order because they are handmade and take time, and I work alongside and do not have the time  to work on more orders.

Now, this is where things take a curve. I cancel and refund her second order because it is also untracked and I do not want her order to ""not show up"". So, I kindly explain to her that I would be unable to cover the expense if the second order does not show up and I am declining this sale. If she wasn't so rude and belittling, typing in all caps, I would have carried on with her second order. But I decided not to take this customer's crap and declined the second sale. 

She went mad! She told me I'm a scam, that she will report me, etc. I did not reply. Not a minute later, she dings me with a 1-star review that said that I gave no reason as to why her package did not arrive even though it was dispatched a month ago (I did!). She wrote that she doesn't appreciate selling items that don't exist, especially since they are a gift. That it was a waste of time, etc. 

My items do exist and any sane person would know because of my other great reviews and photos with the reviews. I don't understand why she would say they don't exist? 

Anyways, I contacted Live Etsy Support and reported the review citing their policy about third party services. Live support agent looked through the convos and told me I did the right thing to decline the second transaction and to report the review. I have been patiently waiting and today got an email that they won't be taking it down. 

This is the first time I have gotten a  1-star review, and  since Etsy is not taking it down, I would like to know if I even should respond to the review or now. And if I should, what should I even say? I am so drained from this situation. It has made me lose motivation to complete my orders.

926,Etsy,"Hey, 

I have my shipping fees as free within Canada, products are just slightly marked up. I myself hate paying shipping so figured it would attract more buyers. However a few of my clay earrings broke in the mail as I was simply wrapping them in tissue paper and using a bubble mailer. 

I purchased little boxes to use to ship so they would be protected, however shipping this method is much much more expensive. I do not think my shop is big enough yet to raise the price of the item to accommodate the higher cost and keep it listed as free shipping. But am also worried about backlash and loosing what little business I have by charging 13$ shipping. 

What do you think would be my best option?Shipping cost changes"
927,Etsy,"I found a beautiful ring I thought was handmade. It came in a custom box and the store had great reviews. I should have known better with the price but I thought they were having a sale and decided to go for it. The ring is 18k  white gold with the band being stamped and the price reflected the gold but not much left over for labor you'd think went into the ring. Instead of going with my better judgment, I assumed because the store was smaller they were trying to gain sales and selling their work short. Also I could not find a similar ring through the search.

However, this morning the same ring I purchased appeared on my suggestion page. I followed it to find this was a different seller from the opposite side of the country as the seller I purchased from. I ended up taking the listing photo and doing a reverse image search (which I should have done from the beginning). Not only did I find the ring on aliexpress for $46 in silver and another for $290 in 18k white gold (several hundred less than I paid) but also several etsy listings with the same ring (which I was unable to find on etsy's search results directly). 

Here's the dilemma. I'm not sure if I should even be upset or not? I do love the ring. If the ring truly is 18k white gold then I do feel I paid a fair price although I could have purchased it cheaper myself. I'm disappointed that it isn't this sellers design like the listing stated and a bit upset to know I'll have to jump through so many hoops in the future to make sure I'm supporting an actual person and their talent. A part of me feels like I deserved to be duped knowing the seller absolutely was not charging for the labor that would have been required.

So my question is what should I do? Should I warn potential customers in a review? Should I message the seller directly? Should I not let it bother me and move on? I feel like it takes away from the sellers with truly handmade items when there are many platforms which this could be sold. It's unfortunate customers are being told it's a custom piece when it's not.Purchase advice"
928,Etsy,"So hey everyone, I'm an artist looking to start selling on etsy soon. I like doing alot of things from sculpting, painting and drawing so I'm kind of struggling to find a fitting name for my shop, I mostly do cute or creepy stuff. Fantasy, sifi, animals, monsters, but also some fanart and human figures, some of it can be a bit surreal. It would be best if it wasn't too specific and would leave the option open to expand onto selling other things. 

 I would prefer if it had my username in it Alpakachii since I use it on all platforms. I thought about maybe Alpakachii's Corner or Alpakachiis Creatures or something like that, altough the latter seems weird if I also try and sell more normal or fan stuff.

Then secondly, I'm looking for the best ways to package said clay figures or sculptures it probably depends on said figure but I just need some pointers since mailing things is totally new to me. I'm going to start out with smaller stuff at first because it can obviously get expensive. What do you put in the package to keep it safe? There are so many options but I don't want to risk experimenting with actual orders. Shipping is the thing I'm most afraid of seeing as things get lost and or break.

I asked the usual questions about shipping to see if I would send her another one because sometimes items do break in the mail and I would have sent her another out of courtesy. When she sent me a picture of the item I inquired more. I knew her story didn’t add up. She was essentially irresponsible with her item. I sensed she wasn’t being truthful with me.

931,Etsy,"Hey guys! I'm back with a new question about digital prints for Etsy.

On a lot of listings, there is a section that says 5 (or so) files will be included that are all at a different aspect ratio (2:3, 3:4, 4:5, etc.)

Quick note, I'm using Canva for all my designs. If I export all my designs as PDF Print files, doesn't the image quality stay the same no matter how large the design is that gets printed (e.g. postcard or poster)? Why would I need to include 5 different files for different aspect ratios, if they can make the file any size they want on any size paper they want?

Thanks guys!More Digital Wall Art questions"
932,Etsy,"First, I want to start off by saying I am not a tax professional, so please consult yours if you need help. But I want to help so here are my tips.

Since we are in tax season, I've seen a lot of questions about how to navigate the 1099K they got from Etsy. Most questions relate to the fact that the 1099K numbers don't match what the Etsy Dashboard says they did in sales.

The 1099 shows a GROSS amount. It does not take into account any fees, shipping label purchases, marketing campaigns, etc. It is a total of all the items you sold. So if you sold 1000 shirts for $20 a piece, your 1099 will say $20,000.

Now, let's say you canceled/refunded 2 orders. That would be $40 less gross income. The 1099K will NOT reflect those refunds. So you must subtract any full or partial refunds.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

The Etsy dashboard (Finance Tab -&gt; Payment Account) will show you a couple of pretty pie charts in the Monthly Statements section, one being ""Sales and Credits"" and the other being ""Fee and Taxes"".

The amount shown in Sales and Credits will NOT be your gross amount. Each transaction (not item, this is per payment) charges you 3% of the total payment, plus an additional 25 cents. So your $20 shirt will incur an 85 cent payment processing fee. This money gets taken from you before the money gets to you, so the sales and credit section will say $19.15.

Etsy does not include this payment processing fee in side of the Fee and Taxes section because they don't consider it a fee because it comes off the top before you even metaphorically touch the money.

The Fee and Taxes tab will include listing fees, marketing fees, shipping labels and transaction fee (the 5% fee Etsy charges you to sell on their platform).

&amp;#x200B;

When you are trying to figure out your total income and expenses, you can't use sales and credits number because that is not a true representation of your gross income. In my example above, if you sold 1000 shirts at $20 a piece, your gross income is $20,000. But the sales and credits number will automatically subtract the $850 -&gt; 3% of $20,000 is $600, plus $250 (25 cents x 1000 transactions), so it'll say $19,150.

So if the 1099K isn't fully accurate (unless you know you didn't do a single refund (partial or full) all year, then by all means, use that number), and the cute pie charts in Etsy don't give you your gross sales, then what the heck should you do? This is where the CSV you can download comes into great use.

I am striking all this out for 2 reasons. See below where I pick back up and make a couple changes.

~~Just below the pie charts, it'll give you monthly statements. You're going to want to download each monthly statement for the tax year you're working on (so in this case, all of the statements for 2020) as a CSV. To do this, click on the month, then look for a ""generate CSV"" button on the right. It'll download and will open up in Excel (or whatever program your computer uses to open CSV files).~~

~~Open the file and the first thing you want to do is sort it by ""type"" (column B). To do this, click the B to highlight the entire column. Under the home tab above, look all the way to the right and you should see ""sort and filter"" with a large A and Z above it. Click the button, and select ""sort A to Z"", or ""Z to A"" if you wish. Either works.~~

~~Then it'll ask you if you want to ""expand the selection"". This just means it'll move the entire row to the correct spot vs just moving the cell in column B. You must select ""expand the selection"" for this to work.~~

~~Now each type of even (listing fee, shipping label, etc) will be grouped together. This will make your life much easier.~~

~~To determine your GROSS sales for that month, you will want to add up all the values for the type of transaction called ""sale"". Add all the numbers in column F for this type. Do do this easily, highlight all the cells you want to add and look in the bottom right corner. It'll give you the sum.~~

~~To determine the 3% plus 25 cent payment processing fees you paid that month, you will do the same thing as above, except you'll highlight all the cells in column G. This is an expense you can deduct, just like shipping labels or listing fees.~~

~~If you had any refunds for that month, you will need to do the same thing (add up all in column F then subtract column G).~~

~~To determine your other fees (listing, shipping label, marketing, transaction), highlight values in column G (red is a payment, black is a credit, Excel will do the math for you).~~

~~There are a couple other types that may be confusing, such as ""Payment"". You'll see this if Etsy charged your credit card (or other payment method on file) to pay fees that you didn't have enough money for in your Etsy payment account. This may happen if you issue a refund but don't have enough funds to cover it.~~

~~Then there is the deposit type, which is where you'll see all the deposits to your bank account. This is a nice way to verify the amounts that your bank statements say, but do not use this total for tax purposes, it does not represent your gross sales (remember that you pay any Etsy fees out of your Payment Account, THEN they deposit the leftover money into your bank account.~~

~~You will need to do these steps for each month. After you add all your months, you'll end up with a gross sales, then all your fees to subtract. Remember to subtract other business expenses like supplies and tools.~~

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Okay, so ignore what I crossed out above. It is wrong. The amount (column F) will include sales tax. Etsy is taking that automatically for most states, so you never see that money and it shouldn't be counted as gross anyway. Gross is only the item price and shipping.

The other reason that is there's an easier way to do it.

1. Download the Etsy Payment Sales CSV (Settings -&gt; Download Data).
2. There are a lot of columns. I delete the ones I don't need, but feel free to keep them.
3. Add up column E (Gross Amount). Notice how it is the same number as what your 1099 says? Great.
4. If you did any refunds (partial or complete), you need to subtract those. But Etsy does the work for you by giving you the Adjusted Gross amount in column K. If you did a refund, it'll show the new gross for that sale. So if column E says $15, but column K says $13, you will need to take $2 off your gross to account for the refund. Do this for each time you had a refund. (Note that column Z says refund. This includes any partial sales tax refund that gets automatically given to the buyer. So this is not an accurate measure of your actual refunds).
5. Do the exact same thing for your ""fees"" (which is the payment processing fee). Add up all of column F, those are the total payment processing fees taken by Etsy. And once again, if you gave the buyer a refund, the adjusted fee amount will show up in column L. Do the same thing, subtract any necessary fees.
6. Get the rest of your fees (listing, shipping labels, marketing and transaction fees) from the Etsy Payment Account dashboard under Finance. Use the drop-down menu right above the pie charts to select ""all last year"". On the right it'll give you the totals for each of the categories I mentioned above.

So now you have your gross (1099K value minus refunds) and all your fees (payment processing fee we got in step 5, and all the other fees in step 6).

&amp;#x200B;

I hope this helps you. Please feel free to ask any questions and I'll try to help. I want to restate that I am not a tax professional so please consult your tax service/software or Etsy support if needed.

So I'm learning all about the technical things involved with selling printable wall art on Etsy.

That made sense to me, and then I hopped on Easy and saw most people were offering their files in JPG format, which I was told not to do because the DPI would be inadequate.

946,Etsy,"Just coming around to noticing the 15% of sale for etsy offline ads. Way to go  Etsy!  Very sneaky way to offset your marketing costs and make the sellers pay up for it.

947,Etsy,"hello, newbie here sorry if this has been asked before. when making a new listing and where you get to add “tags” - is this like a hashtag or just words ? for example, i’m wondering if i should type in “vintagetray” or “vintage tray” with a space between the words. i assume these tags are how items show up in searches - so i don’t necessarily have to put every word in the title of the listing?? thank you!!tags in new listing?"
948,Etsy,"Just wanted to get the communities opinion on whether you guys think its a good or bad idea to give buyers more options in terms of customising your product (if its made to order)? For instance, I sell prints on my shop, and while I have different size options which is pretty normal. 

I thought it would be cool to also give people the option of choosing what paper they would like the print on. My thinking is some people might not like the glossy paper that some stores print on, or maybe they wouldn't mind paying extra for higher quality paper. Do you think buyers like these extra options, or maybe they create confusion which makes a buyer apprehensive in purchasing from a store?Giving buyers more or less options?"

954,Etsy,"Hi everyone,

I've got a bit of a problem, and desperately need some help as it's driving me insane. Seller's perspectives especially might be nice. The ultimate question is 'How do I proceed, to make things happen?'

The short version is: in September 2019, I commissioned a 3D print from a seller, I was quoted £580, and complete in 2 to 3 months at latest, with the agreement of half up front and half on completion. Seemed fair to me. The seller raised an order immediately, which I paid. Come the shipping date, I was told to just sign off the order as it was a deposit and that was how deposits were done on Etsy. Well... now it is February 2021 and he's still not done. Thing is, the deposit is marked as completed, and there is still no 2nd listing for the completed project, so I am not sure what recourse of action I have.

\----

Details:

&gt;!The seller frequently delays. For example: he agreed to set up the listing Dec 23 2020. Then until Jan 19 2020 said he couldn't because a problem Etsy was having with tax arrangement and brexit meant that lots of British shop owners were having problems processing listings. Then said the problem has cleared on Jan 19 2021, and he'd put it up this week. Nothing. No replies until Feb 3 2021 because 'he forgot to turn notifications back on on his phone'. Then more silence. 2 days ago, he said he'll definitely set it up that day. Nope. Yesterday, he said he has written the listing he just needs to press 'activate' but didn't want to send it through at 11.30pm and disturb (I've mentioned before this would be no bother). Today, offered no excuse, but said he'll do it as soon as he's in front of a laptop in a bit. After 12 hours, still nothing. Then said 'You'll definitely get it in the next few hours, tonight'. And again, nope. And that is just for putting up the listing, which has now turned into a 29 day exercise. Many other things in the process have been like this. They do slowly get done, but incredibly stressfully.!&lt;

&gt;!I'm pretty sure I'm not being scammed, because I've seen many pictures of the commission. Many of these messages are over whatsapp because he replies astronomically slowly over etsy because 'notifications don't always work with etsy', so they're split across etsy and whatsapp.!&lt;

My thoughts so far are maybe a phone call, but i suspect it will be more false promises? I guess small claims court is an option, but I don't know the guys address, and after 17 months, I just want my product (which he assures me is on the brink of being finished).

Anybody know how I could drive this forward?

&amp;#x200B;

**EDIT: After a request to sort things out with a phone call, it was miraculously sorted within 5 minutes. Funny that. It was pretty bare bones, the listing only says '\[Name\]'s gun' but it seems to have set a dispatch date of 1-2 weeks which is what I wanted so... yay, some progress. Thank you all. And I paid it via PayPal / credit card this time. Just in case.** Seller keeps delaying a commission I've paid deposit on. How to proceed?"

But I run into this issue. I have a listing were I offer little wet samples (tiny organs in jars), defenitely not my core business (I do taxidermy art) but fun to do on the side.

So basically a customer can order one of the jars and choose what sample I should prepare inside. BUT I set the first language in Dutch and translate to English manually. The variaties I cannot translate (don;t know where). Also, I cannot view the English listing (really annoying) myself, so I have no idea on how to check if the names are translated correctly.

One of the options is 5 random samples in 5 random jars. But I have people requesting very specific things (right now I have a customer who wants a brain, full male reproductive organs and 3 differnt heart species) No problem, but waaaaay too much work for the price.

&amp;#x200B;

So I there any other way to translate the variaties manually? Or to check how the automated translation turns out? to prevent these start-up issues?

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: so its not just the variations, also the materials (first line people see) that are not translated automatically and there doesn;t seem to be a place were I can manually do this.

I asked Etsy if my default language can be changed to English. seems to be the best long term solutionCan I translate variaties manually somewhere??"

So every month I get a little kick of a few bucks, and today hit a hundred (not including my Ravelry shop, which has some PDF's too.) What's funny is this month I made my first custom order, and it's for a much larger item, since it's a completed handmade crochet project (I'm painting a denim jacket and replacing the sleeves with crochet). So for whatever reason I had an activity spike this month, and hit a milestone!

I'm trying to focus more on digital media for my crochet stuff these days. PDF's, videos, etc. Things with a much lower cost and which take less recurring time and effort than dyeing yarn.

969,Etsy,"So last year I opened my shop and it blew up for a few months, I made over $20,000 (sales have been totally stagnant now) And etsy emailed me my 1099.

normally I do taxes on TurboTax, my husband and I work a few jobs (teaching is the main income) And usually get some money back on our returns. I knew this year I would end up owing and I went to enter in all the information and I feel like the amount that it's saying I owe is too high.

I entered in the gross income from the 1099 (which is 2,000 higher than what Etsy shows on its own website?) And then went in and entered the listing fees, shipping, marketing fees, how much I spent on supplies etc. My actual income once you take these things off is about 20k, And it's saying that I owe close to 7k in taxes.. nearly 6k federal and 1k state (Wisconsin). I already entered all my w-2s from our actual jobs as well... But it seems like having to pay more than a third of my actual income from my shop is too high?

970,Etsy,"So I got a message stating there was a label adjustment because my package wasn't the type of package mailed. This simply isn't true I have my settings saved in Etsy and I sell bracelet sets that generally weigh the same amount. So basically my package type is saved, and since mailing a first class package, rate is the same up to 4 ounces I just put 4 ounces because unless I  get a large order everything is under 4 ounces.

SO my issue is I got this message saying there was a label adjustment to $3.91 which is fine the original postage was $3.49 and I figured they just didn't charge the correct amount with the rate increase. The problem is they charged me the $3.49 and now they charged my an additional $3.91. 

When I got to the USPS shipping label adjustment it says to contact the post office but in my opinion this isn't a post office issue this is an ETSY issue since they just took the funds out of my seller account.

I have all the steps I need to take to be a business on a local level, but the tax things I'm highly unsure about. Can I still do the taxes myself, should I get a tax person now, or get a tax person towards the end of the year? Is there any expense tracking software that is recommended?

980,Etsy,"Hi everyone!

I am still quite new to Etsy and I need some advice on how to deal with lost mail. I am in no way saying that sellers are always right in this situation. 

I offer untracked mail for all my items and buyers have the option to upgrade to tracking at the checkout. This is the most cost efficient for both me and the buyers. I haven’t had a single buyer select tracked shipping. To be fair it’s very expensive in Canada.

I haven’t had any confirmed missing packages yet, but have seen other stores on Etsy and other platforms put a disclaimer that says they aren’t responsible for lost mail, damages, or delays. 

I would like to also put the same disclaimer because there is no way to track packages with no tracking and I can’t confirm whether a package is really missing or not. Stuff happens sometimes. I am however willing to replace orders if there’s tracking that shows a package is missing. I’m wondering if it’s enough to prove to Etsy in case I run into any problems in the future if I take pictures of all the receipt and packages with the stamp and addresses at the post office. This shows that I have done my job to send out the packages. 

I’ve heard Etsy automatically refunds customers if they say they haven’t received an item. Is this true? And how does Etsy process this? 

To those who have had experience in dealing with lost untracked packages, how do you go about it? Please let me know. I would like to hear different views on this.

ordered two silk pillow covers several months ago and waited a long time to receive.  i was unhappy as this mustard color was more to the brown side while the internet photo was brighter and had more orange to it. i also purchased a cover that you call bubblegum but the internet shows it as lavender.  neither color was what i wanted and do not match my decor.  at the time i was ill and hospitalized off and on.  when i returnered home i found a duplicate order which i certainly did not order.   someone in your office must have thoughy this was an unfilled order and sent a duplicate. i too have been a single woman raising two children. i know have $200 in pillow covers that i can't use either one.  you sent me a very kind note and i feel we are kindred spirits.  wishing you continued success and good health.  most sincerely...end of the message.

What does she mean? She doesn’t talk about returning them. Most of her claims about the color are non-factual. I don’t have anything like bubblegum color in the shop. I received a buyer note when she placed her second order and now she calls it duplicate. She spent total 200 (98+101.99=200 in two orders). She bought same thing twice.

Edit update: guys, thank you for replying about this.  I checked my FB later today and I got a message from someone calling themselves her niece. They wanted to chat about the return process and that their aunt has dementia and she ended up ordering same thing twice.

But, neither of those numbers give actual revenue, because the $162.09 includes the price of the product, plus whatever the buyer has paid in shipping and sales tax, and the $130.50 is that $162.09 total minus advertising, transaction, shipping, etc fees from Etsy. So you cannot choose either of these numbers to generate the amounts you ultimately need to put on your Schedule C form for taxes. Basically your dreams of selecting transactions and coming up with a number that works for your gross income are dashed.

This brilliant human (and accountant)'s website explains this way better than I can, and I urge you to read it: [https://www.smallbusinesssarah.com/best-accounting-software-etsy-sellers/](https://www.smallbusinesssarah.com/best-accounting-software-etsy-sellers/)

I decided to heed her advice and switch over to GoDaddy from QB SE, but another hang up is that you can't download the CSV from QB SE and then pop it into GoDaddy, which only imports QFX files. So basically all of my due diligence on getting my books right in QB SE is for nothing.  I have to download all transactions again through GoDaddy, and then sift through everything again.

My only conclusion is that Etsy is getting some sort of kickback for selling QB SE to us, and it's gross. I saw an Etsy community post about this and a seller said they called QB directly and QB advised that QB SE is really meant for someone like an Uber driver, not an Etsy seller, specifically because of these issues.

Etsy could so easily fix this in their reporting, too. I don't get it.

PS. I'm not an accounting or finance major so if I've gotten some terminology wrong please let me know!

Curious to know everyone's thoughts and experiences.

UPDATE: Sorry if it looks like I abandoned this thread everyone; I live in Texas and we have had the week from hell down here. No power/heat for 85 hours for my house and it was sub freezing the whole time. Any fellow Texans out there I hope you have recovered and are staying safe &lt;3 Etsy pushing sellers to use QuickBooks Self Employed is SO WRONG"
993,Etsy,"A buyer messaged me today saying that they never got the package and wanted the item. The package is marked as delivered as of Feb 11th.

They are asking me to ""check with the USPS."" They also are saying ""they are going to file a claim with the USPS. They will have to get hold of a supervisor."" They want me to ""please check because they never got it.""

I....don't really know what they want from me.

What should I even say? I'm totally at a loss here.

The message immediately put me on edge, so I don't want to come off as rude/aggressive so I'm asking here for some guidance.How Do I Respond to This?"
994,Etsy,"so far I understand that the amount on my 1099 k is my gross

and the amount deposited to my bank account is my net

the difference between these two are my etsy fees

so where the heck do they show what these fees are?

to try and find out, I downloaded all of the CSV files for each month and I added up the ""taxes and fees"" and it's no where near my total expenses

I also found a column showing all my refunded orders in a yearly CSV so I added that in and it's still only about half of what they took out

there are still $7000.00 worth of expenses somewhere, so how do I find those?

thank you!help figuring out the expenses taken out by etsy and 1099k"
995,Etsy,"My shop is finally established enough where buyers aren’t hesitant to buy or message me. I’m considering taking it to the next level. Is paid advertising worth it and what do you suggest? I’m currently trying to grow my social following on Instagram and was wondering what is the best route or if any of it is beneficial.
I sell digital printables and customized signage, invitations, and announcements. Appreciate any feedback y’all have!Paid Advertising-Is it worth it?"
996,Etsy,"Hello! 

I’m in search of the best and most affordable place to get custom logo stickers for packaging. I’ve looked at vista print and sticker mule and Etsy itself for logo stickers (size 1.5”), but IMO they are more expensive than I thought. $8.45 for 24 stickers. Maybe I’m cheap but I was expecting to pay less than that. If anyone has any reccs, I’d love to hear them. Thanks!Custom Logo Stickers"
