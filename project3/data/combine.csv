Etsy,"Hi! Welcome to the monthly critique request thread. When you post asking for a critique remember there's certain rules you must follow:

You must come with at least one specific question. No ""I just opened my shop, what should I fix?"" If that is your question you probably want to ask how you can improve your tags, or photos, or titles, or descriptions.

Let us know how long you've been open and if you're using Promoted Listings.

If you are possibly infringing on another parties intellectual property it will likely be addressed in the critique. Requests that devolve into discussions or arguments about infringement will be removed. We don't support the unlicensed use of other's intellectual property.

If you are found to be reselling non-handmade products your posts will be removed. We don't support resellers.

Before you ask for help, especially if you're new to selling, give yourself a quick shop critique with the high points most new sellers miss:

* Am I using phrases that apply to your item instead of single word tags?

* Am I using all 13 tag spaces?

* Am I using all 10 image slots?

* Are my pictures correctly white balanced? Do they look good next to other pictures in search results?

* Am I using most of the characters they give me for my title, stuffing it full of my tags and keywords?

* Do I have policies and my about page filled out? Do I have a banner, a shop icon, and my user pic in the about section?

* Am I infringing on anyone's copyright, trademark, or right to publicity? Is my artwork original?

Etsy,"Somewhere along the way, this sub has become dominated by posts either by sellers decrying the ""worst buyer ever"" (bonus points if you call them a Karen), or by buyers with the patience of a saint asking timorously if they should open a case despite not having received the item they were promised six months ago. I think the former likely influences the latter - the prevalence of stories about nightmare buyers seems to make people think that a seller has to have threatened your life in writing before it's okay to open a case!

Buyers: if a seller is fobbing you off; pushing a shipping deadline back over and over; has sent you the wrong thing and is refusing to help; is ignoring your messages and you've still not received what you paid for; *it's okay to open a case!* Yes, do try patience and understanding first; don't open a case without making an attempt to contact the seller; do in most situations message the seller first before leaving a one star review to give them the chance to remedy things (not to extort them, but to make them aware there's an issue). But remember that this is a *business transaction*. This isn't Sunday afternoon visiting at the retirement home with your grandma where opening a case is the equivalent of flinging a cup of tea in her face. Yes, you have the responsibility to be reasonable as a buyer, but you are *not* individually responsible for the success of a shop.

I just see so many people incredibly reticent to stand up for themselves when the seller is blatantly taking the piss. Yes, it's mostly sellers here, and yes they're very vocal about bad buyers - everyone needs a rant from time to time - but that doesn't make all complaining buyers bad! Some sellers are bad too, and when you come across one you don't have to post here asking for permission to advocate for yourself.""Can I ask for a refund?"" ""Should I open a case?"" ""I don't want to ruin their shop!"""
Etsy,"Just did a breakdown on the economics on my shop and it's not looking good anymore..

My latest sale brought in $39.98 and I have their recommended free shipping over $35 turned on.

Lets see where we land..

* Inventory $6.00
* Shipping $10.80
* Packaging $5.40
* (Mandatory) Advertising $4.80
* Transaction Fee $2.00
* Payment Processsing Fee $1.45
* Listing $0.40
* Renewal $0.20

Net Profit $8.93..

Absolutely insane.. I went months not realizing how bad it's gotten. As a vintage seller, all I'm doing is finding inventory and packing boxes, I have absolutely no idea how those of you who actually have to create your items are doing it with these margins but I commend you on successfully doing so. For over a decade I'd try to purchase items at about 50% of my final sale cost.. doing so now results in a large net loss.Etsy with mandatory off-site ads is an absolute profit vampire."
Etsy,"I opened up a shop this year and made about $11k in revenue in 2020. First time small business owner so doing taxes for this is completely new to me. I have read that Etsy is now supposed to be collecting and remitting sales tax for orders automatically.

I'm looking at my financial statements for the year and things aren't adding up. Under the Fee and Tax column in my payment account page every transaction has two different charges from Etsy - one for ""sale"" and the other for ""transaction"". My assumption is that the ""sale"" fee that Etsy charges me is for sales tax and the ""transaction"" fee is the cut that they take for every transaction.

The problem is that the ""sale"" fee doesn't match the sales tax that was charged to my customers for each order. So is that ""sale"" fee not for sales tax? 

To complicate things further, I tried exporting the CSV from Settings &gt; Download Data &gt; Orders (2020) page like so many tutorials suggest and in that CSV file the entire sales tax column is showing as blank for all of my orders. I know for a fact this isn't correct because I've looked at each order and they all have sales tax added onto them.

So what the hell is going on here? Do I have to pay all of these back taxes in sales tax to the state when I file? Or is Etsy paying them? 

And FWIW Etsy freaking SUCKS. I hate this platform, the fees they take are ridiculous and the tools they offer are AWFUL.Desperately need help with taxes for Etsy shop"

Etsy,"I posted at the beginning of this week about my personalised Mother’s Day onesie for my son which didn’t arrive by the date, even though I ordered it in plenty of time. It was due to be dispatched a couple of days after I ordered it and the seller was a little rude when I messaged (Thurs before Mother’s Day) to check whether it was going to be on its way soon. After asking for a refund last Sunday (Mother’s Day) due to not receiving it, the only response I have had from the seller was a generic message saying that a parent has died unexpectedly, all Mother’s Day orders were dispatched on time and someone will be fulfilling all other orders. 

On the advice of someone here, I gave it a few days because Hermes (seller said they were the carrier) can be unpredictable. The onesie turned up yesterday, almost a week after Mother’s Day. Here are my issues:

- It was not sent via Hermes. It was sent Royal Mail, I think 1st class. It also said “post by 20th March” on it, which was yesterday, so I strongly suspect it‘s only recently been dispatched. The seller has not been truthful here. 

- It is appalling quality. I only undid one of the poppers and that one fell off. 

- To top it all off, my son’s name is spelled incorrectly on it. It’s not an unusual name but there are two ways of spelling it and both spellings are commonly used. I checked and I spelled it correctly on the order. 

I suspect that this has been hastily done and only dispatched a couple of days ago. I obviously understand given the circumstances that it hasn’t been easy but I would have much preferred my order to have been cancelled and refunded than receiving something totally useless  a week late. 

I have left a 1 star review and in it said I will be asking for a refund. The shop is “taking a break” at the moment, which is fine, but that could be weeks and I don’t know if there’s a refund window for purchases. 

So is it best to open a case?Should I open a case or contact the seller again?"

Etsy,"It's my first time sending a parcel from UK to USA and after research I am still unsure whether the purchaser of my product will have to pay additional taxes on it. It is a small framed artwork valued at around £20. My understanding is that it may be up to US customs as to how much to tax it depending on the item? But if they do get taxed is it likely to be a significant amount and is this something I should bring up with the customer and offer to pay for, or is this just something that is widely accepted when sending internationally.Import tax on Parcels sent to USA?"
Etsy,My account has finally been reopened after it was suspended for a day and now I haven’t had a single sale and my traffic and favorites are down to where I started practically.

Etsy,"Hi ! So, I recently learned that your keywords must be in the language of your shop to work. My shop language is in French, but I do digital prints, so a lot of them have sayings in English. Also, I feel like there isn’t really keywords for this niche in French, and most of my customers are from the us and not from my country. The problem is, right now, none of my traffic comes from keywords/search on Etsy so I feel like I would be much more successful if I could get sales directly from search. Should I switch my shop language to English ? If you’re an Etsy seller whose shop isn’t in English, what is your strategy and are you successful ?Etsy SEO by language"

Etsy,"Help! My buyer didn't pay customs and parcel stuck.

I run UK based shop, I got order for three heavy knitted items to be shipped to France. I have chosen DPD as the cheapest and safest shipping option and shipped within 1 day, insured (at my own expense) and with all the customs papers correctly filled. Parcel made it to France super quickly, I was able to track it, I of course provided tracking number to Etsy and also DM it to the buyer.

Days went by and parcel didn't move in tracking. After customs being sorted out, no progress whatsoever. I eventually contacted the buyer. And she was like ""oh so this is why X (DPD's French partner) asked me to pay customs. Now I understand it is THE parcel from you. Well, I had issues with paying the customs"". And you tell me NOW ? She also claimed her tracking didn't work (it worked for me, in case of issues she could have contacted me).  And that she thought that customs were included in what she paid, despite me sending her a very clear message saying YOU MAY HAVE TO PAY EXTRA CUSTOM CHARGES ONCE IT ARRIVES. She took some actions in order to clarify it with X services after my message. At least that's what I was told. But it was too late to pay customs and she was told parcel will be returned to sender. She apologised etc. Now this parcel is most likely lost, I'm in touch with DPD customer service hoping it will be returned to me somehow one day. Buyer however had a very unpleasant convo with me yesterday when we discussed circumstances of the whole event. She claims that she receives many parcels from abroad so it's **obvious** that she didn't immediately connect customs issue with THIS parcel, duhh. But if it was me, and I had issues with completing customs payment, I would find which parcel it is that I can't pay for and at least would inform the seller ! Buyer insists she did everything to receive the parcel and I can't agree. Am in the wrong here ? She got ultra upset and offended when I suggested that there was not enough done at her end in order to receive the parcel and avoid current situation. Because I really feel that I did everything I could, and could have done more if I was informed ON TIME that she can't have her customs paid due to some email-phone number issue. So yeah, am I wrong here ? Btw I'm assuming she's telling the truth about inability to pay the customs due to some error, although her mentioning how high the customs charges are few times and suggesting that I could re-send it once it's back to me with other services because she heard it is cheaper and customs also could be lower, is kind of a red flag for me and makes me question her explanationBuyer didn't pay customs, didn't inform me, now parcel is probably lost"

Etsy,"So about a month ago I got an order (a bronze sword) from a person that lives in Australia. My shop is located in Greece (I make handmade bronze statues that are 100% made by me using the method of casting). 

Everything went smoothly , the item was shipped in time etc. Suddenly 2 days ago the buyer sents me a message demanding a 35$ refund because as he said ""The item doesn't match its' description and looks better in the pictures."" I have to tell you that we sent him the exact same sword he requested and in the listing details the size of the sword is crearly stated correctly (9.5 inches in length). 

When we told him that the statue is actually the correct size he requested a refund. We gladly accepted ofcourse but he demanded we pay for the shipping costs as well. Now I have to point out that in our shop policies we have stated that we accept refunds/returns as long as the buyer pays for the shipping cost.

Ofcourse he refused to pay the shipping and called us a ""ripoff"". He made a case on the sale and then gave us a bad review as well on Facebook.

We messaged him with screenshots and photos of the same sword in our workshop that prove that the sword is actually the correct size but he said that he will contact PayPal and he will do it the hard way now that we didn't pay him back the 35$.

Is there something we can do? He clearly has bad intentions and I don't wanna see a bad review on etsy. I have made more than 250 sales so far for the past 4 years and have never had such a bad experience with a buyer.A buyer made a case on my shop"

Etsy,"This girl is the sweetest buyer I’ve ever met. She ordered a customized picture frame from me. I shipped it all the way from Toronto, Canada to Mississippi and sadly it arrived broken. 

She said this sometimes happens with her UPS packages as the delivery person just drops them and they shatter. I felt so terrible and immediately offered to refund her or replace it at no cost. I profusely apologized and thanked her for being so nice. 

That’s when she thanked ME for being so nice because apparently the last time she ordered something from Etsy and it was broken on arrival the seller basically said she’s SOL and made her pay again to replace it. 

How sellers can do that is beyond me. I understand things break during shipping and it’s beyond our control - yes it sucks, but I definitely don’t think it’s the buyers responsibility to buy it again if they want it. Broken packages are a cost of business.

I wouldn’t even fathom making a buyer pay again for something when it’s technically my fault it broke and they hadn’t even touched it before it broke. I don’t just do this because I don’t want a bad review but I just can’t in good conscience make someone spend hard earned money twice on something that’s my fault. 


TLDR; package shattered in the mail and the buyer said thanks for being so nice for offering the replace it at no cost because the last Etsy seller she had a broken package with said she had to pay again if she wanted a replacement.A package I shipped arrived broken - and the buyer is thanking ME for being so nice for offering to replace it for free? I feel bad for whoever screwed her over before😭"
Etsy,For context text I ordered something on January 8th. The things takes a month to cure and such so I expected to get it before Valentine's day and then that came and went. I have contacted the seller multiple times they ensured me the first time that they were sending it out that week. A week later I contacted again asking for tracking information got none and was told it would be shipped out in a week. 10days and I still have no items and no shipping info. I feel bad but I feel like I've been more than understanding. Another mention their shop is literally a town over from where I live so even with shipping it shouldn't take long once they send it.Should I open a case?
Etsy,"Hi everyone! 
I'm a beadsmith (I guess that's the term?), who mainly designs and makes goth/victorian style jewelry. 
I'm fairly new to Etsy as a selling platform, mainly because I was previously unable to ship items abroad (I'm based in Argentina and it's a nightmare to try and sell outside of our country), but I've finally found a trustworthy  and efficient way of doing it and I've begun my attempt at going worldwide.
Thing is, I have been selling domestically for a few years and have been lucky enough to amass a few loyal customers. The question is, is it important for potential buyers out there to find a section with ""happy clients"" to look through in my media? Would it help build people's trust that I indeed fullfil my orders and deliver what I advertise?

Etsy,"Lets say I try to sell custom PC cases for PC hardware enthusiasts, but need a few small electronic parts such as a power button/USB, etc. Is my only option to go to AliExpress, or amazon and buy really cheap Chinese knockoff brands that last a week before falling apart according to review?

Etsy,"Is there a difference in visibility between offering free delivery for everything as opposed to free delivery if you spend over a certain amount or buy a set amount of items? 

I currently offer free delivery on everything but when people are only buying one pair of studs it makes up a large proportion of the revenue to offer free delivery. I'm just scared that if I stop offering it that it will hurt my shop as I keep hearing how much etsy prioritises it. I was thinking of offering free delivery when you spend over a certain amount, but does this still garner that same priority appearance and does etsy perceive this as free delivery if people search for that?Does free delivery actually make a difference?"
Etsy,"Hey everyone. Sorry if this may sound like a dumb question but I'm trying to order an epoxy table worth C$1400 from a seller based in Turkey and I'm trying to figure out the customs on it. So I asked seller if they can lower the price on receipt so I don't have to pay 30% on 1400. Seller told me they can't do it as price is marked by Etsy but they'll mark the item as gift. They said they've done this before with previous customers in Canada and they were not asked to pay any customs. I, however, am still unsure of it.

Has anyone tried to do this or know how customs on gifts work in Canada? If I buy a similar table from Canada, it'll cost me a lot more (around C$5000). I'll buy the table anyway as it's still cheaper than buying it from Canada but I'mjust trying to save some money on customs. If anyone has a suggestion, please share it.

Etsy,"So sometime in the last few days, Etsy updated their review column to display Item quality , Shipping, and Customer service stars. I have  over 800 reviews, with the vast majority of them being 5 stars. Probably less than 25 of them are 4 or less.

Etsy,"Lemme preface by saying i try my best to go above and beyond for customers. when something is their fault (i.e, wrong address given or wrong color ordered ), Depending on your attitude with me ill do you a solid and resend an item minus the cost of shipping instead of making them rebuy it or something since i wont lose a huge profit and because being nice is easy and feels good.

Enter Karen, ordered from me and gave me the wrong address. Only the city was wrong though, no big deal, but street address was correct so now its in the correct city after it bouncing around and not moving from the PO for like a week. She messaged me asking where her candle was, i nicely explained that it seems there was a delay because the city she put down was wrong but that its in the correct city now, apologized for the delay, and its still on its way. She said the address was right and that the city she put was an area inside of the correct city (which its not, its literally a completely different city at the end of the state and confirmed by usps as being a different zipcode) and that ""well ive always used that address before and it worked!"" (Because the PO figured out what city you MEANT and EVENTUALLY figured it out). She then said it needs to be delivered that same day since shes going out of town as if im the shipping fairy and can hand deliver things on command. Basically said its still on its away and that if ends up not being deliverable (which honestly it shouldn't be) and comes back to me, ill resend it with the right city or just refund her minus shipping.
 
Got a snarky one word response yesterday which i didnt respond to, until she just messaged me today and said still no candle with a snarky emoji. Not much else i can tell her because its still in transit so i repeated what i said and told her to just check the tracking number for updates.

At this point im sick of her attitude so im like...should i just let her leave an inevitable one star that ill publically respond to professionally and kindly or should i refund and cancel her order even though its still on its way just to get her off my back? Im also worried she'll open a case which ill most likely win because i can prove i shipped it on time to the address she gave me but i dont want it to affect my shop.Should I prepare for a 1 star or refund her and let her get free product?"

Etsy,"Hello everyone, hope all is well.

I made a purchase last night on Etsy that I was extremely excited about obtaining for my upcoming birthday. I paid via Apple Pay as I have done with many past purchases without any issues but I woke up this morning to an email stating the order I made last night was canceled with the reasoning being that 'This order was cancelled and refunded based on specifically-reviewed criteria designed to help protect our marketplace.'

Now the shop is very new, only 1 sale, so I contacted them and they told me Etsy described the reasoning for the cancelation was because it was an unauthorized purchase. I authorized the purchase so I took my question to Etsy and am waiting for a response from them but I thought while I wait I would make a post here to see if anyone had dealt with a similar situation.This order was cancelled and refunded based on specifically-reviewed criteria designed to help protect our marketplace."

Then I used the feature on Sellbrite to import the listings into Etsy. I had planned to use the sync feature in Sellbrite so once an item sells it will be removed form the other platform. The photos on Etsy look absolutely horrible. They are blurry even before the zoom feature is used and once zoomed they are really terrible. It is so bad I refuse to even use them. Very unprofessional. Can anything be done to fix this? Please don't say take new photos because I have a lot of listings and that is not happening. I sadly just won't use Etsy if I can't figure out a solution for my existing listings / photos. Anyone have a similar experience? Thanks!I'm using Sellbrite to import my eBay listings to Etsy. Once the Etsy listing is live the photos on Etsy look blurry. Terrible!

Etsy,"Hi everyone.

I have an Etsy seller account as an individual and want to add my business information to my account. The business is an S-Corporation with 2 incorporators and the other person is the registered agent since I still don't have an SSN. The shop has almost reach its limit as an individual account and will have to be a business account before this Mother's Day. I don't want my shop will be suspended because Etsy won't allow my business information since it's registered under another person's name.

Is it possible for me to add the business with the other person's information as the owner since I follow this shop's sales completely. Does Etsy allow each incorporator have their own etsy shops, or do I need to open an account under the other person's name.

I didn't think I could reach the limit before I got my SSN so didn't think about this before.

Etsy,"Just received a laughable 1\* review for one of the lowest priced items in my shop. 99% of my reviews are 5\* and I did attempt to communicate with the customer without response so not much I can do at this point besides shake my head. 

The item in question has a 4-6 week processing time but i've been busting my butt lately to catch up on orders before my baby is due and shipped out this person's item an entire MONTH early. After initially sending me a message asking why their order took so long to get to them (item only spent 3 days in transit before being delivered), I let them know that it was in fact shipped out early and they never responded. Now they've left a review stating ""the item took nearly a month to arrive, &amp; the seller did not communicate with me at all about the delay"". They are also upset that an item included for FREE with their order was not the color they liked. 

Probably going to go the good old public shaming route with my response &amp; let them know AGAIN that their item shipped an entire month ahead of schedule but wow am I tired of dealing with customers like this.

We are a small husband and wife team who make ***Damn Good Bondage Rope***, out of our shop in southcoast Massachusetts! (No we're not from Boston! XD). We dye, spin by hand, and condition two different fibers of rope, in over 50 colors. We also dye and re-sell manufactured ropes, in over 16 different colors with two rainbow options.

We just hit out **10,000th sale**, and we are completely overwhelmed. Six years since I took a trip down ""do-it-yourself"" lane, we are at the best point in our business journey ever. I just got done with building a new shop building on our property dedicated to this business, and moved our operations out of the basement, and sun room, and second bedroom, and dining room (only after resupply deliveries).... you get the idea!

Being an adult rated business through this pandemic has brought on major highs, and major lows. We currently have 52 active listings, which is an all time high for us. We did the majority of our business with \~35 ish listings.

My wife quit her job to work this full time, hopefully I will soon!

&amp;#x200B;

This will lead me into my ""Narrative for discussion"",

***How do we handle making products to order, with repeatability, so that orders are similar over years?***

**-This is specifically related to dyeing materials;**

I know there are plenty of you who are mixing dyes and rinsing fabrics on here! We have dyed dozens of different mediums using 5 different dyeing techniques and currently process 10-20 dye baths per week across two main different fibers!

* We use dye cards to record each and every single batch. We monitor quantities of dye, fixative, water temperature etc. If we have a batch that is different, we double check our temperatures, double check and be sure we grabbed the correct measuring cup. It really helps us isolate and reduce wasted material!
* Pre-wash your material!!! I cannot stress this enough. Washing material with something that removes oils is key to getting even and consistent dyeing.

**-This is related to the workflow on your end;**

* We use every single order flow option Etsy gives us. (And I wish we had more). This whole process really helps us to focus in on what needs to be done now vs not a priority. It allows us to stay on a singular task and be more efficient with our time.
   * Our new orders section is filtered and emptied every day, or more frequently.
   * Orders that need to be dyed go into a category ""To be dyed""
   * Orders ready to spin go to ""Ready to spin!""
   * We also use two other workflows;
      * A ""Todays Worklist""
      * A ""Tomorrow worklist""
      * This lets us parse out and plan our week several days in advance.
   * And Finally we use a ""Ready to ship"" category to dump orders into as they are spun and/or direct ready-to-ship items!

If you made it here to the end, thank you so much for reading! I would love to answer any other questions I can to help!

&amp;#x200B;

*I remember saying after 1k, ""It will be forever before I hit 10k"". Now I say with certainty... I can't wait to write my post for 100K. Because I will, and it will be soon!*

Etsy,"I guess this is mostly a rant?

I have a shop where I sell sterling silver jewellery, and my biggest sellers are two different rings. The rings are premade, truthfully, bought from a reputable seller, and I fit the stones. They are stamped 925 silver. 

A buyer aggressively messaged me this afternoon telling me it clearly wasnt sterling silver and it was fake, as it has tarnished after a week. The tarnish mark is a blotch. Her aggression instantly upset me, but I politely explained that sterling silver can tarnish when subjected to certain chemicals - e.g. strong bleach, but a quick polish with toothpaste would easily buff it out. I suspect the buyer has used a chemical due to the shape of the tarnish mark. 

She wont try to buff it out as apparently the silver has ""chipped and cracked away"" and now will leave me horrible feedback. I'm not a busy shop. I have just shy of 30 sales and five 5* reviews. I do this for a bit of fun on the side as I build my experience making jewellery and was looking at expanding, as I have learned to smith my own simple bands. 

I just dont know how to reply politely. I am confident that my jewellery is 925 silver - I cant wear or really handle plated jewellery as the other metals upset my skin, and I wear what I make. I buy from a reputable seller. This woman hasnt even requested a refund and just seems to want to be aggressive and rude.

ETA: Have just realised she purchased as a guest, so one worry out of the way.

ETA 2: Thank you everyone for your help and advice, I have learned a lot. I calmed down and responded this afternoon, explaining if she returned the ring I would either refund her or polish/replace. She's instead chosen to keep the ring and try polish it herself? I have no idea anymore. 
I have purchased a silver testing kit for future use.

This item that was accidentally cancelled was the last in stock, so it shows up as unavailable.

Will the item be put back up automatically after the refund goes through, or should I ask the seller to repost it?

I’m asking because I don’t want to look extra dumb as I already spoke to the seller so it would be very awkward.

Etsy,"Hi,

  I'm trying to figure if I would draw more customers with lower prices/shipping fee or higher prices/free shipping. I make hand forged ironwork, so all of my larger items $35+ like fire pokers have had great success with free shipping. I am more concerned about my smaller items that are under $20, likes hooks and bottle openers. For example, I can charge $7.50 for a hook with $3.75 shipping, and I am making a fair profit. However, when looking at similar successful shops on Etsy, some offer a similar hook for $7.50 but with free shipping. Now I feel like I need to offer free shipping just to compete with this shop. But doing so would cause me to make barely anything on the sold item between fees, shipping costs, and materials. Do customers really care that much when they see the free shipping banner? I do offer $35+ free shipping, and feel it might be a great way to get more items purchased since Etsy now does the item paring, but I wish they made a banner to show we have the guarantee.

I've been selling on Etsy since the end of Jan of this year and I had a few questions about what is legally required to sell items.

On Etsy, since our sales taxes are remitted/taken care of for sellers, I've read online that a Seller's Permit is not required because of that? Additionally, I live in California and I was wondering if a Business License was required if I'm ONLY selling on Etsy? I've read some forums online but I get mixed answers.

Etsy,"I’ve seen TikToks lately of people printing their own stickers lately (like those “thanks for shopping small”) and I always wanted to buy some so I thought wow why not make my own. I know this could be a very lucrative business if the price is right. I also have my own small business and figured I could use the printer to print shipping labels (I don’t do high volume at all but I figured by combining both of the reasons it would give me a good excuse for buying one). 

I’m looking at the MUNBYN label printer right now. I’m in Canada so on Amazon it’s about $220 and on the website directly it’s $176 with discounts. Does anyone know if you’re charged import fees when you buy directly off the website? I’m obviously hoping for the most cost effective printer and it looks like this brand is the cheapest and best selling. 

And just give me your overall review! Do you like it? Is it worth the money? Would you have bought a different one knowing what you know now? Is it easy to use? Do you only use it for shipping or for stickers too?

TIA!Looking for feedback on the MUNBYN label printer (either for printing and selling stickers or just using it for shipping)"

They took 5USD in taxes
Then another 14USD from the off site ads thingy.

I don't understand this. The buyer was pretty sure that she only clicked the link I have shared.

Is this right? Or am I being ripped off?

If you're a seller who takes that into consideration, how do you communicate that possibly to potential customers?

She bought a matching couple ring set from my shop and the other ring was allegedly sent to her boyfriend who lives in another city as her. ( She is in Ontario and he is in Quebec). 
I asked her to send proof of products as photo and she sent me the one she has in her car but refused to send me the other photo which her alleged boyfriend has. 
Claims she is on lockdown and cannot go outside because of her safety and has no local community box to receive or send mail back. 
I checked her neighbourhood area and there is obviously local community boxes. She is lying about not having one and lying about not being able to go outside when she obviously can. (Proof she is going outside because of the photo she sent in her car).
She refuses to send back my products and refuses to accept a free replacement. Very stubborn and rude customer.

Well, I messaged her today and she basically made up a bunch of excuses about being busy and my order being sent back to her...I gave up on that situation but she said something that kind of hurt...She basically told me that I didn't send her anything physical (because my business is printables and digital products lol) and that it was just a picture, and even tough it was pretty it was just a picture....referring to my custom illustration of her that took me 2 days to make ... And now I'm thinking maybe she's right and that's why no one really wants to buy my products... Should I just close the shop?

I woke up to a sale, 6 shop favorites and 423 views on my shop! As some of you pointed out, it is a really difficult time for everyone and it is not easy to have something that people feel like they NEED to buy in the current economy, but we have to keep going and someday it will pay off! Thank you!I'm thinking about closing my shop...I'm starting to feel really discouraged"
Etsy,"I bought something off of Etsy last month and paid in full via PayPal. The item was dispatched last week, but I’ve just received a message from the Royal Mail saying that there is an unpaid shipping fee that I have to pay otherwise the product will be sent back to the seller.

The only problem is the seller does not accept returns so I’m not really sure what to do. I don’t know if the responsibility rests upon me or the seller considering they’ve never mentioned an extra fee. I’m a first time Etsy buyer so if this is normal please tell me

Thank you :)New to Etsy and...confused?"
Etsy,"Hi! I’m based in MA and I am turning my Etsy shop into an LLC. I have 2 questions:

The lawyer I hired has advised me that I need to include the “LLC” in my shop name, business cards, logo, etc. I really don’t want to change the name or include it, is there a way around this? I rarely see shops that include it so I’d like to avoid it. 

Second, he told me that because I am selling to other states, I should check with those states to make sure there is nothing I need to file to legally sell there... but it’s an Etsy store. I sell to all 50 states and internationally, so...??

Thanks :)

Edit: I also realized that of course, Etsy doesn’t put spaces within shop names. So I would have to make the letters LLC part of my shop name, which would turn it into a nonsense word that is very hard to search for. I also looked through the ~700 shops I have favorited, and not a single one ended their name with LLC. So I’m going to have to stress to this lawyer how much this will affect my visibility - no one will know to search for it, and I also just don’t want to change the name to a long nonsense word.Filing as LLC"
Etsy,"So I had some available for deposit (not a ton) but I made a decent amount of sales today. I see my current balance is positive, but now my available for deposit amount is 0. Why is this?

Etsy,"Hi all! First time posting here, I hope I’m using the right tag. I recently started a custom hand embroidery shop, and I received my first order!! 

So what I make is highly custom - I have to draw out the design first then hand embroider. The embroidery process typically takes 4-6 hours. 

I sent a pic of the design once it was complete and received confirmation from the buyer. However, I’m wondering if it’s best practice (or if it makes sense in my case) to also send a picture of the final product before shipping. Part of me would like to, to make sure it’s to their liking. However, it’s mostly unrealistic to make changes once it’s complete without tacking on another 1-3 hours of work. 

What do you guys think? Or for people with similar setups, what do you guys do?

Thanks so much!!For those who do custom orders - do you send a picture before shipping and allow for tweaks?"

Etsy,"**TL;DR: A strange case of a buyer claiming she received not what I sent. No real problem here.**

For the context: I am an artist and my style is somewhat difficult to imitate. I sell my original art as well as posters (which I print locally and send myself, so no 3rd party involved).

Just woke up (time difference) to a hysterical convo from a buyer, all caps etc, saying she received something totally different from what she ordered and please please could I help. Attached was a photo of a picture of the same theme that her order was (she ordered a *print* of a fish, and the picture was a *watercolor* (?) of exactly the same kind of fish, same color, but a bit different composition) clearly done by a child or a totally unprofessional person. Obviously not what I sent, but looked like someone made an effort to make it similar to mine, not seeing an original.

Me: ""This is definitely not what I sent. Can you take a picture of packaging?""

Buyer: ""Let me go check the package -maybe it was for another home"". 3 minutes later: ""Omg this is not for me I’ll have to return to office -I’m so sorry  I thought it was yours -can you tell me when will I receive my art work  -I’m so excited waiting for it that I just opened this package not  noticing it was not mine.""

Me: ""okay, hope you will get yours very soon. No worries""

I sent 3 orders to the US on the same day as hers, two of them delivered yesterday (got very positive feedback), so her order was indeed about to arrive. Normally I don't believe in this kind of coincidence (would you?), but it doesn't look like a scam either (or does it?). I karenchecked her (I do it routinely for all orders) and there's one normal review of hers, nothing strange.

Don't know what to think really. This is not a major issue for me (it was one of my cheapest listings anyway), just an uncanny feeling. Needed to vent it somehow.

Has anyone heard of anything like that? I had my share of difficult customers, so I thought I can hardly be surprised, but this was something!Impossible coincidence or a new type of scam?"

Etsy,"I have an Etsy shop that was (originally) meant to sell my personal crochet patterns and designs, as well as physical things that I crochet. Recently I got into making crochet kits and started a company that focuses primarily on crochet patterns, tutorials, and kits. On that site, I am a featured artist and feature other crochet artists as well.

I sell my kits and patterns on that site, but people often go through my personal Etsy to purchase as an alternative. As I am growing my new company brand, I was thinking of making a secondary Etsy shop to put the patterns and kits onto, this way I can somewhat distance my artist handle from my brand a bit and feature kits using patterns and tutorials that I am not the artist for (they are commissioned and I get permission for this via contract).

My secondary Etsy shop that fits the new company brand will have some of the same items as my artist handle (kits and patterns) but also some additional kits that I don't feel comfortable putting on my artist Etsy page. I would take new pictures and redesign these listings to look slightly different, but keep my original listings as well since they have been selling really well from Etsy search and I don't want to lose that traction either.

This also has the added benefit of having 2 of the same items listed from 2 different shops giving me twice the visibility in the search and discovery. The downside is having to re-grow my status through reviews, sales, etc, but I would still have my original Etsy listing too.

My question is this. Will I get in trouble for this since it will be essentially the same items for sale from the same seller (me), but in two different shops, even if the images, titles, and descriptions are slightly different? It feels morally questionable like I'm cheating the system a bit. Not enough to fully deter me but enough to see if I would get into trouble with Etsy themselves.

Would love any feedback on this! Thank you so much for reading!!Should I create a secondary Etsy Shop with the same items?"

So, I messaged the seller in a very friendly way and just asked if he had any shipping info he could share with me. That's when he apologized extensively and said that he was so busy that he forgot he even had a shop on Etsy. To make up for it, he even offered to add in some other gifts. I told him not to worry about it and to take it easy on himself because he sounded so busy, and we had a nice, cordial conversation.

""I bought this sweatshirt as a gift and the recipient absolutely loves it. **Its** a very soft **materiel**, and the embroidery is incredibly well done. Everything about it is high **qualitey** and I couldn't recommend it enough.""

Etsy,"I recently purchased an item from Etsy for the first time and paid the suggested shipping fees alongside the purchase price of the item. I received an email from the seller asking for my phone number to aid in the shipping process, and then another email asking the below (paraphrased):

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;I will ship it in 2 days. If you wish I can ship by (mail carrier) , it arrives in 5 business days and it requires $20 more. I checked that you have bought the item from offsite ads , etsy receives 10% fee more for offsite ad sales . If you wish I can cancel the order , refund your money ( it may take a few days to transfer to your bank account ) and list it again for you and you make the purchase directly from etsy .This time you are required to pay only $10 more for expedited shipping . You will pay $20 instead of $10 for shipping .Thanks ,Seller

&amp;#x200B;

I am not sure what offsite ads means and, also, why I would have to cancel my order, reorder, and then pay more for the expedited shipping? Could I not just go with the standard shipping that I paid for through Etsy? What I suspect is that the item was listed offsite of Etsy, a service which costs the seller a set fee that they are hoping to avoid and will compensate me by subsidizing express shipping.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't particularly like the idea of having my order canceled and having to reorder the item while my funds are still not transferred back to me, but, maybe I purchased the item from the wrong link that wasn't etsy's home site and the seller is trying to save me money?

Etsy,"Hello everyone!

I hope you're all doing well. My shop sells body creams and perfume oils (and soon selling soap) made with locally-sourced goat's milk. Before I offered an unscented version of our body cream, I found that customers bought our Oatmeal Milk &amp; Honey body cream since it is a little more subtle. I've heard a lot of great, positive feedback from customers, but have also heard that it was stronger than they were expecting. This led me to the idea to offer a free sample, slash ""try before you buy"" type of thing, where I could send them a really small (0.25 oz) sample of the body cream before they purchased the whole 8 oz jar of it. 

I don't believe that Etsy allows you to offer anything for free, and the minimum is $0.20. Also, I'd hate for a customer to dislike the sample and leave a negative review for something that is literally free. 

Anyone have any ideas about how I can offer this while avoiding a negative review on a free sample? My only idea was to have them message me and let me know their address so that I can send it.

Etsy,"So I make photo albums and made a mistake on the listing description. I wrote that the photo album is A6 (which it is), but had the wrong dimensions listed out. Customer reached out after receiving the package and let me know that the dimensions were wrong and asked for an exchange. I apologized and offered an exchange for the photo album with correct dimensions (if she mailed back original album). Customer then responded and said she'd prefer the exchange due to a project she's working on, but wanted the exact placement of the patterned paper on the cover to match the original album. I said that's not possible due to the handmade nature of the patterned paper (each one is unique) and offered a full refund and to pay for the return shipping label. Now the customer wants me to provide photos of available paper so she can pick for the cover. This is turning into a custom order and while I understand the customer may be frustrated with me and my mistakes, I don't think I should entertain the idea of a custom order.

Etsy,"So I left a review for a shop yesterday, and today I received this message from the seller.

If there is something that needs to be improved in my product, please feel free to let me know. If not, please take into consideration the impact on the seller when you leave an inaccurate review in the future. 

And it seemed a bit unprofessional to me? I just looked through the subreddit and it seems that ratings do have a huge impact but a 4 star review in a sea of 5’s seems to not be harmful imo!

Etsy," I have an issue with a buyer in US. It's an international order shipped from Singapore to US with normal mail tracking. The order has been shipped out on 21st Jan but the buyer only received it on 3rd March. The package has already reached US on 29th Jan but there was a delay in the sorting by USPS in the US. She was very unhappy and contacted me on that in 2nd week of Feb. I contacted the shipping company and they explained that due to bad weather in the beginning of the year and backlogs from the covid situation, there is a low manpower and they are trying to clear it as soon as possible. It was unfortunate that this package was delayed but the customer could not be more unreasonable. I have tried my best to follow up with the shipping company and it was really beyond my control. 

On 25th Feb, she suddenly claimed that she needed the dress for her son's birthday and demanded a compensation of $125. (50% of the custom dress cost) so she can use it to buy another dress for the event. She threatened to give a bad review and do a credit card chargeback on the order.

First of all, I was never communicated about this dress had to be delivered by 25th Feb. When she contacted me in mid December on a custom made dress, I specifically asked her when she needed it. I told her I was really busy in December and January due to all the festive seasons (Christmas, New Year and then upcoming chinese new year in mid Feb) and will not be able to take in any order that needs to be rushed and there will be a long leadtime for the incoming orders. My schedule was already packed. I also mentioned that if she needs it by a specific date, she has to let me know and it has to be shipped via expedited mail. 

She said she has no rush for it and will touch base in Jan. However, she placed the order on last day of Dec. Since with the assurance that it's not a rush order and there is no specific date needed, I went ahead with the order. After we finalized with the measurements, it was already the second week of Jan. I still prioritized her order to ship ahead of the schedule. It could have been shipped only in 1st-2nd week of Feb and it will still not be able to make it on 25th Feb without shipping delay. (as we all know, international normal shipping has been slow since the pandemic.)

Now that she has received the dress, she demanded the refund of $125 (50% of the dress cost) to ""turn this negative experience to a positive one"". I think it's clearly not fair for me. If she had told me that she needs it by 25th Feb, I definitely will not have accepted this order or either only allow expedited shipping for the order. She insisted that I was to be blamed for the shipping since she ordered in Dec and not received until March. But yet she said that she agreed with my production timeline mentioned to her before and was happy to give me all the time I need.

I don't think it's fair for me to get blamed for shipping as it's beyond my control and I have clearly communicated the leadtime before she placed the order. It's certainly not fair that I have to make a loss on the order after so much effort is done to make a custom dress if I have to compensate her $125 for the dress so she can use it to pay for another new dress. 

I also offered her another alternative. Since she no longer needs the dress for her event, I offered her a full refund if she ship back the dress and will reimburse her the shipping cost. She became unhappy and threatened to post the entire experience in a bad review in my Etsy shop. 

I asked her to ship back to me but she insisted that she will not step out of her house to post the package and I have to arrange a courier to pickup from her and send her the pre-paid label. i think she purposely wants to make it difficult as it's a lot harder for me to arrange a courier to pickup from her place since I don't stay in US. Even though I don't think I should pay for her return shipping, I just want to settle this instead of arguing further with her. 

I did eventually manage to contact DHL to pickup. Now, she demanded me to pay her for the envelope cost and refunded her first before she will hand over the package to DHL. I told her that I will only refund the order upon receipt of the dress.

She kicked up a big fuss and opened a case on Etsy against me. She complained about the delay in shipping is unacceptable. (ordered in end Dec but received on 3rd March) and said I hid behind covid and used pandemic as an excuse. But that's a fact. I have tried my best to file inquiries with USPS and shipping company on my side but that's the answer I have been given. 

In case she opened on Etsy, she threatened Etsy that she will contest the charges with her credit card company if nothing is done and threatened to blow this matter up on social media. But she has already received the dress and I even offered to do a return and refund her the order even though it's a custom dress. I don't think I should refund the order first before she shipped out the dress. She basically went crazy in the case she opened on Etsy and typed many essay-long messages, threatening Etsy and me. She insisted on the full refund before she will even send out the dress.

Etsy,"I sent a message to a seller with a question about an item in their store about two days ago (3 hours shy of 48 hours). I'm going to wait to at least the full 48 hours, but then should I send a follow up message? Should I wait a few more days? What's the proper etiquette? I don't want to come across as pushy or aggressive, but I am also concerned that my message has somehow been missed over.Sent a message to a seller about two days ago, and haven't heard back yet.

Etsy,"I’m looking to buy multiple self-care, mainly bath/shower products, but I kind of don’t want to have to buy from 5 different shops having to pay for shipping 5 different times. 

I want to be able to choose from bath bombs, shower steamers, body scrubs, lip scrubs, bath salts, candles, etc. However, most of the shops I find will have just one or two. Like if I find a shop that has bath bombs, that shop typically only has bath bombs and maybe bath salts. If I find a body scrub, that shop doesn’t have bath bombs. 

I’m just wondering if there any shops where I can buy all the items from.Are there any shops that sell a range of self-care products?"
Etsy,"I’m in a difficult predicament and I’m not sure what to do. A buyer purchased an item from me last year. The items I sell are in the $200-$350 range. She received her item and disliked part of what she received (despite receiving detailed photos before shipment and approved of her item at the time). 

Then, she filed a complaint with Etsy and we went back and forth and to save myself a headache, I issued her a partial refund of about $70-$80. She was content with that. She then went and left a one star review. I blocked her as a buyer because she was particularly nasty in her language in addition to just being difficult to work with. 

I thought that was the end of that. However, she has now placed a second order with me. I blocked her previously, but she made another account and made another purchase. I know it is her because it is the same name and same shipping address.
I am wondering if I should go ahead with her order and hope this is a better experience, or just refund her and block her again to avoid a repeat experience.
Let me know what you think. Thanks!

Update: I refunded the buyer and canceled her order. I also sent an email to integrity@etsy.com and will reach out to Etsy support if I have further troubles with this buyer (and I probably will, honestly). Thanks for the help!


Update #2: I refunded and canceled her order and she later messaged me asking why I canceled, even though I already explained that I couldn’t make the order for her. I then got ANOTHER ORDER shortly after she messaged me, but it was for a different name and different address, but I am suspicious because the new shipping address is only about 30 mins away from the original. I suspect that this is the name and address of a friend or relative. Thoughts?Buyer who left bad review and received partial refund made another purchase"
Etsy,"Hi, I hope this is appropriate for this thread. I just purchased a piece of furniture from an Etsy shop that had thousands of reviews with photos (how I checked to make sure it’s not a scam... though second guessing myself now). Right after I purchased a coffee table from the shop I got an email from the shop owner that Etsy closed his store (for no apparent reason) and he still sending it, and I was promised a tracking number.... which I’m still waiting on. I don’t think I can open a customer service issue until the expected delivery date.... but my question is has this happened to anyone else? If so.... did you receive your item or got scammed out of $$? What should I do based on the above described situation? Note: I paid through Etsy and it linked me to PayPal to pay for this item... PayPal makes me pretty nervous.Bought something expensive and the shop shut down?"
Etsy,"I noticed all of my listings have been renewed way more than I thought. I realized that the amount of renewals is linked to each order (ex. 11 sales, 10 renewals, because someone ordered 2 units in one order).

Is there a way to turn this off or does etsy just always take that $0.20 out? And is that ON TOP of their other fees?Etsy always renews listings after every purchase?"
Etsy,"I have purchased from Etsy countless times and never ran into this issue, but I am not sure if this is normal or if I am possibly being scammed? I am no way blaming the seller but I just want some insight from others. I always leave reviews and not a difficult customer, I swear!

I purchased a wallet on 3/3 from a seller in Turkey. The shop only has 4 sales and 1 review which made me hesitate to purchase. However, I used a gift card for part and PayPal for the rest so I really wasn't too worried.  On 3/7 I received a message from the owner stating that shipping times have changed for the carrier and my package will now ship on 3/12 or 3/15 instead of 3/6. I said 'Okay. Thanks for letting me know.' He sent me another message on 3/10 stating my estimated delivery date is now 3/30-4/15, with links to an Etsy article on 'What is an estimated delivery date?'

I realize it's only the 17th but I have sent a few messages asking for any updates on shipping but feel I am being ghosted since there has been no reply in a few days. I would cancel the order if I could but the shop doesn't allow cancellations according to it's policies. 

Am I worrying for nothing and should wait it out, or do I need to contact Etsy?Question about shipping times and sketchy shop"

Etsy,"
This is going to be super long, just a heads up. Before I start, please refrain from judging. I recognize the decisions I made wrong and have definitely learned my lesson. I want to get this off my chest because I feel so angry. 

A couple of weeks ago, I received a message on Etsy from a buyer saying she was interested in one of my original canvas paintings. 16”x20” is the largest size I have for sale in my store, thus the highest priced item. So I was elated.

However, she said she was wondering if we could get around purchasing from Etsy and send a check instead. (Red flag #1)

As part of my shop policies, I only accept online payments. I responded to her by starting with thanking her for her interest in my art. And that in order to protect myself and my small business, I unfortunately could not accept a personal check as a payment. However (mistake #1) I could give her an exception where, if she would be willing, I’d need to have that check in my possession first, deposit and wait for the funds to clear, before I could send out the painting. That’s fair right?

She was excited and accepted. She said her uncle would be the one paying so she said to stand by while she talked with him. (I assumed it would be like a birthday gift or something from him).

Anyway there were a few back and forth emails between us and a rapport was built. She seemed genuine and I hate to say this but she wrote pretty well and to me, if I haven’t met them in person, the way a person writes speaks volumes about them. But who knew that scammers could write intelligently? How dare I stereotype huh. By this point she had already given me her home address to send the painting to (To me this was a sign that I could trust her, but still not enough to not type it into the USPS website just to make sure it was a legit address. And it was). Then she said her uncle had issued a cashiers check made out to me. I worked in banking for 3 years too so her saying it would actually be a cashiers check instead of a personal check made me feel a bit more comfortable because those are verified funds right off the bat. Though they could still be forged, as with everything else, they were at least somewhat a better option than a personal check. So it was sent to my PO Box, and we waited.

I get an email from her apologizing saying that there was a mistake made and the check coming to me was for more than the amount I charged for the painting. Apparently the check was for both her and her cousin and she didn’t realize it when she asked uncle to send it straight to me to avoid longer wait. She asked if once I received the check, to send her the extra funds so she could give it to her cousin. I said of course I would. 

I went to my P.O. Box every day for several days until it finally came. In those few days she kept asking if I’d gotten it, which I could understand feeling a bit anxious about it since it was a large amount of money (painting was for about $300, and the check I received was almost $1300), especially if a huge chunk of that is supposed to be for you. She was very polite about it, thanking me for understanding that this was a family matter and her cousin needed the money, obviously. By this point, I’d already gotten the painting all packaged and ready to go, so as soon as I deposited the check I’d send out her artwork, since we’d both been waiting for a couple weeks. 

I mobile deposited the check into my account, but it was placed on hold for a couple days, as is standard. I took the package and dropped it off at the post office, anyway (Mistake #2) with my thought process being that it was a cashiers check; it will clear. 

I sent her the tracking info and she was pretty excited. Then she asked me instead of turning around and writing a check to her cousin and mailing it out, if it would be better to send it to them via Zelle (Red flag #2). My bank already is connected with Zelle so I have an account. I was apprehensive, but agreed (Mistake #3)

So to remind you, this check had been placed on hold, and the funds wouldn’t release for two more days, so I DIDNT actually have her payment yet, but I got paid from my other job so I figured maybe I’d just send it now since they really needed it. (Why am I like this)

She gave me the person’s info. Name + email address, which are two of the minimum requirements for sending money via this platform. The name looked pretty fictitious to me (Red flag #3), as I’d never heard of such name, but I didn’t want to be that person who discriminates based on someone’s name. So I actually went on Facebook and Google and just did a quick search, and I was somewhat relieved to see that there were a handful people with that name. Guess I’d just never come across it before.

So I went and typed the name in the boxes, and then I wasn’t about to manually type in the email address, I never do. So I copied and pasted instead. You know when you type an email address on your email, it sends as a hyperlink (underlined and blue)? I right clicked and copied, and went onto Zelle and pasted it into the box. Well what pasted was a completely different email address (Red flag #4). Confused, I went back to the email she sent, and double checked the cousin’s email address. When I hovered over it, it showed the same address that pasted earlier, which was different from what she typed. I’m not an expert in deciphering illegitimate email addresses, but I assume there would be a way to use someone else’s email and somehow change the name of it to something else.

I sent the buyer a quick text (by this point we’d already exchanged numbers because we got in touch a lot), and asked her which email was correct. Of course, she said it was odd but the correct one should be what she typed. I shrugged and just manually typed it anyway (Mistake #4). 

Money was sent (BIG MISTAKE #5). She asked for a screenshot confirmation and thanked me a lot. 

All of this happened on Thursday. 

It’s Tuesday now, and this is where it gets interesting. 

I received an email notification from my bank this morning saying the held funds are now available. Sweet. I went on my banking app and noticed that the funds were NOT available, and instead the check amount was subtracted out with “Returned check” plus a $5 fee. So the email was conflicting. I notice all this before the bank opened so I couldn’t call them yet.

I hadn’t heard from the buyer yet since our last exchange Thursday, so I decided to go and check the tracking status of the painting since it should have gotten there Saturday. She’d told me she would send me a photo once she received it. Went on the USPS tracking. First it said “Out for delivery” on Saturday, then an hour later, “Return to sender request processed”, then “Intercepted, redirect as per sender request”. I didn’t request anything to be redirected? Why couldn’t it be delivered? Where is the package? Who intercepted it? 

I sent an email to the buyer, “Good morning, do you see this tracking?” To my surprise, she responded with a text right away (it was like 0430 EST) and said she would look. With a “how are you today?”. At this point my gut instincts were freaking out and this time I didn’t suppress it, which is what I should’ve done from the start. I ignored her question and waited until she saw the tracking status. Of course, she responded with “hmm, it appears to me that you intercepted it and redirected back to you?” To which I replied “I did not intercept anything and I wouldn’t have even known about this had I not checked the tracking status on my own”. And she goes on to say I’m so sorry let me get a hold of my uncle and I’m sure we’ll figure out “reimbursement for you.”

Hmm, how odd because I hadn’t even mentioned about the check being returned, and she was already going on her autopilot script about reimbursement. I bluntly asked her how she knew about the money when I hadn’t told her about it? All I got were excuses.

Anyways, she kept telling me she’ll figure this out and get it taken care of, and she’ll stay in touch.

(Im going to tell you at this point that her name is ELIZABETH SANDERS, just so y’all can be alert and be on the lookout for her name, especially if you’re an Etsy seller.)

Few hours later, I was able to get in touch with the bank and asked about the returned check. Surprise, surprise, check was returned due to it being altered and fictitious. Again, I worked in banking so I’d know quickly if a check looked odd. This check, I’m telling you, my husband and I examined it this morning and it’s as legit as it could look. It even has a security hologram, watermark, and everything else. I’m glad the bank caught it. I quickly told them about my situation, and thankfully, they got right on top of it. They also filed a dispute for the already-sent Zelle payment, to see if we could get that back. They said a fraud crime has been reported, and that this person would not be able to scam other people anymore. Meaning they’d be arrested. 

After I hung up with the bank, I then called the USPS in PA that processed the return to sender request, and I asked about the interception (my worry was that these scumbags still wanted to steal my painting on top of the money) but thankfully, the post office was the one who intercepted the delivery. GET THIS. The address I sent the painting to is an Amish farm, for one, and no Sanders lives there. Two, they said this Elizabeth Sanders has been flagged by their post office because this month alone, 10-15 packages had been sent to this address, and the poor farmers were getting bombarded by random packages they didn’t know what to do with. I feel bad for all the other sellers who they’ve victimized. I hope they got their items and money back as well. But that no one else would fall for this person’s crap moving forward.

I’m taking a deep breath right now. So. My dearly loved painting is coming back to me. My life’s work. Thank GOD. 

Guess that’s what I get for being so kind hearted and flattered thinking someone wanted my art enough to go through this entire ordeal, when in reality they could really care less about the painting and just wanted the money. One of my worst fears for being an artist is my work being stolen online and sold by others without my knowledge, but I never imagined being flat out scammed. How did I miss this?? As I said, all the red flags were there from the start, I just didn’t listen to my gut. UGH.

**

The last exchange we had through text went like this: (and this was after I’d verified the fraud with the bank)

ELIZABETH: I’ll have to check with my uncle and let you know what I find out. I’m sure we’ll figure it out. I’ll be in touch

ME: It’s obvious at this point that this is a fraudulent activity so I’m not sure what else we’d be figuring out. You know what I mean?

ELIZABETH: Excuse me? I’m not sure I understand. I will never put you in a situation as terrible as that. Would you have me handle this and we’ll be done please.

Deep inside I wanted to believe her, to give her the benefit of the doubt, that somehow she wasn’t involved and that it was the uncle who had tricked all of us. That was until the USPS corroborated everything. 

Im not sure how the authorities would go about apprehending these people considering they used a random address, but I’m hoping for the best. 

At the end of the day, I’m getting my painting back unscratched, my money back, these people hopefully arrested, and most importantly me learning my lesson.

Etsy,"Oh God, I don't know how I haven't just told her to F off!

We have two stores, one is newish and the other we've had over 100 sales mostly shelf orders. 

Sent a customer shelves last Monday and the courier never delivered them, if anyone is British and uses Hermes they'll know they take ages to respond and have a reputation of being rubbish when you look into them! We've now changed. 

She messaged me Tuesday to ask when I would dispatch them, even tho I had dispatched them the previous day, I responded as soon I saw it letting her know she should have had an email
Letting her know they were dispatched. Thursday she messaged me to ask when they would arrive, I missed this, it was my partners 30th so I was making a lockdown birthday special. Friday she messages again the same message, I apologise and let her know I'll contact the courier and why I was rubbish at replying. I didn't realise she had opened a case. Courier didn't reply over the weekend- wasn't expecting them to. Sunday night I message her letting her know and that's when I notice the case. 

Monday I get up and rush making these shelves again, pay £16 for next day delivery with parcelforce. Making shelves is hard work but i did it whilst my 6 month old kicked off! They were picked up, let the customer know. 

They didn't deliver them...

All hell breaks loose, she kicks off calls me a liar, says I make excuses, I've ignored her for days... Etsy closes the case in her favour. She gets a refund. She replies to my message kicking off some more saying if the shelves aren't delivered tomorrow she wants a full refund even tho she already has one. Honestly she was horrible. I had a little cry- I know sad! But I worked so hard and sacrificed time with my little one to make her happy and she accused me of all sorts and left me a scathing untrue review!

Etsy,"I needed help from Canadian sellers here. I was trying to figure out my taxes and how much GST and HST I am suppose to pay to Canadian govt. 

I am confused because there are a lot of numbers per transaction/ order so I wanted to ask people who are actually doing it. 

So say someone purchases something from my shop and paid the taxes based on their province. So the total they paid is 'X'. Now when Etsy gives me money they give 'Y', they deduct some fees and tax from it. On top of which they deduct transaction fees off the same order which is a separate entry on the CSV and for an order I get an intotal of 'Z'.

When I calculate GST to give do I calculate it of 'X' , 'Y' or 'Z'. I thought I have to calculate of 'Y' or 'Z' because that is what I have received for the order.

Can anyone help?

I read that Etsy is a three strikes and you are out place so I don't want to risk getting banned permanently...My plastic toy butterfly knife got taken down for being a weapon... Best way to proceed?"
Etsy,"In which kind of listing do you think should a seller put his/her instant/digital download custom line art portrait ( and which kind of listing buyers more prefer for this kind of service?)

Etsy,"I sell sewn objects that are ready-made (IE I only list items that are made and ready to ship). I make a few items in several different fabric options. Right now when I get an order I fold these objects, wrap them in all together a piece of tissue paper, tie them up, put on my branding, etc, and ship them all in kraft bubble mailers. Very simple and semi eco-friendly packaging. 

I have been considering for a long time to place each item in a plastic cello self seal sleeve. There are several reasons why. Not only would it protect these items in storage, and help me organize everything, but it would further protect them if the package is damaged, and its something that would really be beneficial for in person sales events. The thought is that I would have a designated sample unwrapped to be handled by a potential buyer, and all of the items themselves would be nicely folded and laid out in baskets in these clear cello sleeves for a buyer to pick out their desired fabric. That way, these items are not being handled so much in person (only to be sold online later), would be easier to sort through, I could put the price directly on the cello sleeve with a small sticker, etc.

My concern is that, from my perspective, most buyers on Etsy are relatively eco-conscious, myself included, and if I ordered several items from a shop and received everything individually wrapped, I would raise an eyebrow not only because of the sheer amount of plastic, but also because it makes the items seem ""less-handmade"" so to say. That much plastic is something you expect from Amazon, not from a handmade seller on Etsy

An alternative I have considered are glassine bags, but patterns are much more difficult to see through them, which removes most of their benefit for in person sales events, and would make packaging items much more difficult for me as it would be harder to quickly find the item I am looking for.

So - is this something that I should do? Any alternatives?As a buyer - How do you feel about plastic packaging/Items being individually wrapped?"

I want to use etsy in the combination with printful to sell t-shirts with my designs but I don't understand something. 

Printful will keep some money for making each t-shirt plus the VAT and I am ok with that.

Etsy,"I am having a terrible time with international shipping recently. I've been on Etsy for ten years and never had a problem. I posted about this before and someone told me to buy international labels somewhere else. I had never done that before so I was hesitant, but now I'm rethinking.

What is the deal with this printing a U.S. label (for international) and then it gets sent to a distribution center where it gets a new international label? That just started in December and it's happened twice with international orders and there is no way to override it. When I go ahead and print the label and drop it off, that's it. Package gone. I still have an international order from Christmas that has not gotten there and now I have another order that was shipped 3/8 and it's still saying pre-transit.

Etsy,"Hi!

I've been loving selling on Etsy and my brand is home decor items with really cute graphic design illustrations depicting designer purses. These are all illustrations and many brands do this. I know NOT to list an item as ""Chanel lover coffee mug,"" etc, rather, ""Designer inspired Mug"".

&amp;#x200B;

There are dozens and dozens of stores that have been around on Etsy for years and years some with 10,000 + sales, others with 100,000 + doing the same thing I am.

&amp;#x200B;

I just received a few of my popular listings delisted because of copyright and I do not have Chanel anywhere on the listing or even on the product itself. It's just an illustration. I'm wondering if I'm being flagged because perhaps in my tags I have ""Chanel"". ? 

&amp;#x200B;

I have done hours and hours and hours of research about this over the last year and know the importance of saying ""designer inspired"". These art works fall into the category of Pop Art.

Etsy,"Am in the U.K. for context. 

I ordered a personalised “my 1st Mother’s Day” onesie for my son 11 days before Mother’s Day via an Etsy seller, giving it plenty of time to arrive. A week after I ordered it (Thurs last week) it still hadn’t been dispatched so I contacted the seller and asked if it was going to be dispatched soon as obviously I wanted it for Mother’s Day on the Sunday. I know the post is a bit iffy on the U.K. at the moment so was surprised he’d left it that late to post. I got a curt response back saying they were very busy and that it’ll be dispatched tomorrow (Fri) on 24hr delivery. 

On Fri, the delivery got updated to say it had been dispatched via Hermes but no tracking number. 

Saturday afternoon, I contacted the shop again saying that it hadn’t turned up so could I have the tracking number to see where it is? I got an auto reply saying they were away all weekend but all Mother’s Day products had been dispatched. 

Mother’s Day came and went and no product. On Monday, I messaged again and asked for a refund. There’s no point having it now as the event has passed. 

This morning, I got another generic response saying that the seller’s father had died unexpectedly and so he wouldn’t be in the office for a while. Someone else would be fulfilling outstanding orders and all Mother’s Day goods had been dispatched. There was no reference to any of my messages. 

So what do I do? I don’t want to be insensitive if his father has just died. However, ultimately I’ve paid for goods I haven’t received and I have no way of checking it even got dispatched. Any advice would be most welcome. 

Side note - just to further complicate things, we recently moved house and the order auto-filled my old address. I did message to give my new address straight away and the seller said he would send it there. The people at our old house haven’t received it either and are keeping a look out for it. It’s another reason I want the tracking number - I want to see where it’s been sent!Advice needed re missing goods"

Etsy,"I ordered an item ($250+) from an international seller based in Russia on January 17th. I didn't realize that at first, but that's fine. The item shipped on January 29th via Russian Post. The last tracking update on February 7th says ""transportation."" 

I reached out to the Seller regarding how long it usually takes an item to arrived in the U.S. The Seller said I should receive it within 29 days from when it was shipped. That would've been February 29th. When that didn't happen, I messaged the Seller again who said it should arrived by March 6th. That didn't happen either.

Finally, I asked the Seller to contact Russian Post to see if they could find out anything further. They responded that they did, and that the item was in the U.S. and is being transported. It is now coming up on 2 months and the item has not been received, and I have no U.S. tracking information.

I understand there may be COVID related delays, but at what point do I assume the item is lost? If it becomes clear it is lost, how should I handle that? Request a refund? File a claim with Etsy? File a claim with my credit card company? Other?

Etsy,"So, she doesn't have an Etsy shop (I think), but basically what happened was that about 2 weeks ago I received an Instagram message from another small business asking if I wanted to do a product swap, I followed her on Tiktok and actually liked the products (jewelry) ,  so I agreed. My business is selling printables, so I explained that I don't have physical copies and she seemingly didn't want it anymore, but suddenly she sends me one of my posts (of my most expensive product, custom illustration portraits) and asks like ""omg you make these?"" But she already knew, the first message she sent me was reacting to my story about said illustrations.

Anyway, we agreed that I would make her an illustration and send her a digital planner in exchange for a necklace from her shop (I knew it was unfair bus she said she would share everything I sent her and she had a decent following compared to my 130 IG followers). So, when it came time to pick what I wanted suddenly most of the products were sold out or unavailable, we agreed on a beaded necklace and she actually sent me videos of her making it and everything. And she said she would send it on Monday (it was Sunday).  By Tuesday, I think, I had her illustration and sent it to her (stupid me, I know), she shared it on her personal IG, not her store's, which I thought was weird but she had 5000 followers so I didn't mind.

She thanked me and said my necklace would be sent on Wednesday (so...not Monday?).  Meanwhile she started posting tiktoks and IG stories with the necklace on her and announcing a new collection and I just thought ""I hope that's not the same necklace, we're in a pandemic...""

Anyway, on the same day she posted a story saying that she had personal problems and that Wednesday orders would go out on monday...so by now there's a week delay...but then on Wednesday she posts another story, in line at the post office!!

I really wanted to believe everything was fine because I want to support other small businesses and I know how hard it is to manage your personal life and business sometimes...

Since then she has done a lot of tiktoks packing orders and stories about products and other stores receiving her products. So I just brushed it of and thought why would she send it to other people and not me! Meanwhile she has not posted my products anywhere else or done the tiktoks she promised with them.

So...this past tuesday I messaged her asking if she had already sent it because I was genuinely concerned that the post office had lost it or something like that. And she told me she has a lot of classes and that she would send it on the next day (Wednesday) or Thursday and that she would tell me when she sent it. Well, it is Sunday and nothing, even tough she keeps posting videos packaging orders...

Should I just ignore it and never do a product swap again? I don't really want the necklace that bad (or at all at this point)...I just wanted to connect with other small business so that we could support each other...

What do I do?

I think sometimes people think that because they are digital products they are not ""valuable"" but the illustration took me about 2 full days to make and with the planner, I ended up sending her about $17 of products....

EDIT: I also just remembered that the week I sent her my products she did a bunch of stories on her store's IG showing products she had received that week from other businesses...and nothing about me...and I ignored that because she had said that she was going to print the illustration and I thought that maybe she hadn't had time to do so... So...I think I got scammed by another small business, how do I go about it?"

Etsy,"Hi everyone, so last year I started selling on etsy and around June and July the niche I was in really started exploding and I was selling tons of stuff. At my peak I probably had over 100 orders in one month. It definitely tapered off due to various reasons (the niche I was in becoming less relevant but not completely irrelevant) but I was still selling maybe 10-20 orders a month by the time November came around. I was worried about getting things out in time for Christmas so I went into vacation mode in early December, then turned vacation mode off right after Christmas and sales did pick up ok in Jan and Feb. But I've only had one single sale since the beginning of March. I know a lot of that is due to the fact that a lot of my products have become less relevant but I'm also wondering if the algorithm has decided to stop showing my shop all together and if I should be worried. If I start listing some new items that are more relevant to today, should I expect the algorithm to pick those up again or should I just accept my losses and start a whole new account? Has anyone managed to steer their shop back into good sales after a period of very little?

Note that I have had mostly positive reviews (and all 5 star reviews since December at least) so it doesn't seem like that's dinging my account.

Thanks for any advice or experiences that anyone would like to share with me.Can shops die? Did my shop die? Can it get a second chance?"

I have about forty other orders I'm in the process of fulfilling and only one overdue (this is probably my fourth in total over the past few months; two were only overdue by like an hour or two, another by a couple of days because of a processing time issue), and hopefully they can see that I've gone back and forth with the customer and am currently waiting for her to approve my design? If it helps, I don't have any bad reviews and have over 400 sales.Does having a single overdue order affect anything?"
Etsy,Is that fine to do on Etsy or are they just lucky the didn’t got seen by Etsy directly. I saw a shop and they sell the same sticker set I saw on Ali and they ship it from Germany and they even use the same product photos.

Etsy,"I ordered two pieces of furniture that go together from a seller on Etsy.  Box 1 came with a metal pole sticking out- it wasn't packaged well- but no obvious damage.  Box 2 came, I opened it and it was damaged.  So I returned box 2 and was charged $100 for further damage saying it wasn't packaged well, despite using the same materials (there wasn't much materials in there), and $85 for shipping.  I just told them instead of replacing box 2, I want to return box 1.  Total order cost was $1100.  

I don't think I should pay damage costs or shipping costs for damaged products- and should get a full refund.  Do you guys agree? Am I being unreasonable.  I'm waiting to hear from the seller. and I proactively opened a case with Etsy.Purchase Dispute Process?"

Ok brand new seller here. Read through some posts in this sub looking as to why my listing was inactivated. Found that I used #momlife in my tag and title, and although my product said nothing similar, I used that tag knowing it was a popular tag but my dumbass didn't look up the copyright.

I sell pendant jewelry that comes in multiple styles and colors, and offer several kinds of fancy variations. I’d like to create a “build your own piece” kind of system, but since Etsy limits listings to only two variations, I’m wondering:

If I were to offer only the base pendant as a standard listing, and listed options such as necklace type and embellishments as add-ons, would that make it too complicated for buyers to navigate/too complicated for me as the seller to maintain?

Etsy,"I’ve made several purchases over the years and I made a purchase from a seller whose shop has mostly 5-star reviews and was open in 2020. The shop is based in Singapore.

I googled Hysan LLC and it has HORRIBLE reviews. Now I’m confused about who this seller is.


I read that Hysan LLC is connected with brushing scams. They basically create fake transactions so they can leave 5-star reviews on their own profile. Then they send customers worthless products.

I had a customer order something, which was shipped within my processing time. After some time they contacted me to ask where the package was because they hadn't received it. I said I would look into it and get back to her asap. 

The tracking wasn't showing any update information, I looked into it and the shipping company said they couldn't locate it. Sucks, but these things happen especially these days. 

I sent out a second package and after it had already sent, the customer said they didn't want it anymore. 

I told her I couldn't refund her since the second package was in transit and she started going off how unprofessional it was for me to send out another order, she didn't believe the package was lost, I must be lying or just forgot to send it because she had received other packages from other places no problem. 

She started making all sorts of accusations about me and my business and how dare I blame the pandemic. She said she if I didn't refund her immediately etsy would force me to. 

She's now opened a case saying I'm refusing to refund her and Etsy should stop me selling on the platform! 

I've already lost money on the order, by having to send a second package, I really don't want to refund this person who will get their money back and the items and I will be out three times on it.

Etsy,"I paid $20 ($14 + shipping) for about 24 pieces of candy when I was supposed to recieve twice the amounts because the seller mixed up the order. 

i contacted the seller the day the candy arrived on the 16th of february and she was extremely sweet and helpful, she was very apologetic about her mistake and told me she shipped out a replacement package with the correct order the following day with some extra goodies to compensate. 

when she was mentioning this, she did not give me a tracking # of the correct order she was shipping out, but i figured she probably just forgot and it would arrive soon enough because she shipped it so quick! 

now it’s almost a month later and the package she claims to have sent out with the correct order still hasn’t arrived? i don’t know what to think. even in the worst of USPS times during december of 2020 it never took this long to receive a package...

she’s in florida and i’m in massachusetts so it’s not even traveling that long of a distance. 

many of her recent reviews are not great as well —  many complaining of long shipping times and incorrect orders……😳 

yesterday i messaged her and said that i hoped she was doing well, and that it was okay if the package potentially hadn’t been scanned yet, but that i would like a tracking #. 

she has yet to reply and it’s been a whole day so i am kind of not expecting a response. 

in the case that she doesn’t respond do you think i should file a dispute on etsy and will my images of the candy i received, packaging and messages be enough to cover me? i feel terrible that i have to do this but i also can’t afford to have spent that much on candy and only receive half of what i paid for. i also paid with paypal as opposed to card - will the $ go back on my paypal?Unfortunate situation with seller :("

I always post my orders out the same day so it gets there the next day most of the time. But the customer messaged me yesterday asking for a tracking number so she could see just how far the item had reached. 

I gave it to her and checked the tracking myself only to find that it is sitting in a post office after the postman was unable to delivery it (no one answered the doorbell). It was been two days. 

Customer was amazing!! She called the building that the gift was supposed to be delivered at. They said they hadn't seen it. I was getting worried because 1. It's a gift. 2. I don't want to mess up my new etsy experience. Then she gave me the phone number and I called the building. Nothing. Because the postman did not drop a ""something for you"" card. Customer then drove for 20 minutes to a post office to find out more info. Delivery was rearranged for today and yay, it's been delivered. 

I apologised to the customer because her surprise for a child's birthday was ruined. She said I had nothing to apologise for. I'm just proud of the way she handled things and the way I did too. It wasn't her fault and it wasn't mine. It was Royal Mail :/ 

I just wanted to add that I have ordered from etsy and always make sure I leave a feedback etc. Sweet customers truly do make a difference. So if you ever have an issue with a buyer, please give them a chance to rectify and vice versa!

Etsy,"For those of you who have yet to see, Etsy appears to have changed it’s viewing format on at least the mobile website.

I have yet to see if this is the same on desktop.

In my personal opinion, I’m not a fan of the change. Perhaps it will take a while for it to grow on me, but I just find the gaps in the portraits ugly and distracting. It makes seeing all the thumbnails more difficult.

It reminds me of when someone is trying to fit a paragraph of text alongside an image in their PowerPoint, so they squish it to the side to make it fit.

In general, it just seems like such a waste of space to force all of the images into a weird portrait mode like this.

Again, I haven’t checked what it’s like on desktop.

I don’t mind if Etsy decides to go in this peculiar design direction, but I do hope they change how it looks on mobile.

Etsy,"I just want to motivate you guys a little bit! I see so many stories about Karens and awful buyers, that I want to share a positive one with you that happened recently :) 

tl;dr: 

I sent a small item to a buyer, it never arrived. After 3 months I sent off a new one which resulted in about -11€ loss for me. A few days after I sent the item off, the buyer contacted me saying, that the first one did arrive. They then offered to pay in full for the additional one. I was very happy about that and proposed that I would omit shipping for them, so that I would be able to just cover my losses without making any profit from the sale(s) and save they buyer about 10€. Every party was happy with that :)

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

&amp;#x200B;

So I sell small animal plant pot hangers ( Pretty much animals that you can decorate your plant pots with). Their sales price and thus my margin is not very high. (About 10 € per piece with  4 € material cost, not factoring in labor time)

A while ago in mid-December I got an order for one of them, so I sent the product on its way with tracked shipping. All was well until about 2 weeks ago, when the buyer contacted me about never receiving her order. She wasn't in any way rude, she just inquired about where it might be. Sure enough, I check the shipping and it went from Germany to Overseas fine, but in the destination country it had been stuck in ""Pre-Transit"" since Dec 20th (So over 3 months!). The buyer and I considered the package lost and since its the sellers responsibility, I sent off another one with tracked shipping for which I paid 17€ out of pocket (Materials + shipping, not considering labor time). So now, with my extremely small margin, I sat at about -11€ loss from this sale alone. 

&amp;#x200B;

Then, just a few days ago I get another message from the buyer "" I just received the first package. Thank you for sending the other one anyways! As soon as it arrives, I will pay for the second one!""

&amp;#x200B;

I was so astounded, since most buyers wouldve probably never contacted me about the first package, let alone offer to pay for the second one! Since it is and was my responsibility as a seller to get the product to them and I thought their offer was so generous, I told them that I would omit the shipping fee, so that what they pay for the second one covers my losses, but I won't make any profit from it. They and I are both happy with this arrangement and now we're just waiting for the second product to make it to them!

&amp;#x200B;

I also contacted postal services about the absurd shipping time/loss of the item but of course they never got back to me :) Despite me purchasing insurance for said shipment.

&amp;#x200B;

I hope you will encounter a buyer as honest and friendly soon!A story to motivate you - the opposite of a Karen!"

Etsy,"Hi everyone. I placed an order for a plant on Feb 13. The seller had a note that said she would take a couple weeks to ship, but that was fine because it was super cold. I started paying attention around March 1. A shipping label was generated, so I expected my plant to arrive soon. Nope. Never actually was put in the mail. Now the seller has 'temporarily' stopped all sales and is 'taking a break.' I've tried messaging only to be met with automated responses. I went through the Etsy 'help with an order' process and requested a refund, but because a shipping label had been generated, I had to wait until yesterday to be able to open a case. Miraculously, yesterday, the shop owner replied with an apology and said she would ship today (yesterday). New shipping label generated. However, it's still marked as pre-transit. While I've been waiting, the shop's reviews have taken a nosedive with multiple customers describing this exact same experience. I'm doubtful I'm going to get my plant, but I can't open a case because of the shipping label thing. How do I get my money back?

Etsy,"Hey guys!

So I’m trying to find the best mockups for prints to put in our Etsy shop. Placeit has a lot of great mockups for wall art that I’ve found, and it’s been recommended over and over and over again in videos and blog posts that I’ve researched. 

But last night, my partner and I uploaded some mockups into the spot where you put your product pictures, and it gave us the warning “pictures look best when they’re 2000px on their shortest side”, meaning our mockups weren’t big enough. Literally none of the mockups we found seem to be that big to start with.

So what gives? People recommend this site ALL THE TIME. And yet their mockups are all too small for Etsy.

We fudged our first listing by just putting them in Canva and making them be 2000px by 2000px by dragging the mockup bigger, but that diminishes the quality and is just another added step that feels tedious. And a lot of the features of the mockup get lost when we expand them in our 2000px by 2000px template, like a bed will get cut out or most of the set will get cut out.

How do you all Placeit users get around this? We can’t afford and don’t have the skills for Photoshop. Are there any other freemium sites that actually HAVE Etsy-size-approved mockups without having to make them bigger in Canva before posting them?

I see the follow transactions from Etsy:

\^ these I expect and understand

  
Tax?? = $116.72 - $104.96 = $11.76 - $8.01 = $3.75

Etsy,"I’ve recently made the full transition to more sustainable packaging. I sell greeting cards and art prints. All of my products and packaging are either recyclable (eg, my paper products) and/or recyclable and biodegradable (eg, my plastic sleeves for shipping).

I will include details of what I use in my descriptions but I was wondering if I could also include something in my banner indicating this as well.

I don’t want to mislead anyone so would including something like “eco-friendly products and packaging” be misleading in anyway? I would explain in further detail in my shop’s “About” section as well as on each product listing page. From what I’ve researched, “eco-friendly” is a pretty vague term.

Etsy,"Hi! I'm new to Etsy so I was hoping to get some advice from people who are more experienced in the Etsy community. I opened up an Etsy store roughly two months ago, but I didn't publish any listings because I was still in the process of taking product photos. So, my store was completely empty and had no sales. I recently logged into my Etsy account a week ago, and I noticed that my account had been suspended, but I received no email as to why. I sent the following support request:

""Hi! I created an Etsy account over a month ago in hopes of starting a store, but I didn't put any products into my store then. I just logged into my account today and it said that my account was suspended. However, when I went into my emails to search for the Etsy email explaining why my account was closed, I couldn't find it. I'm hoping you can clarify why my account was closed and what I need to do to reopen it. Thank you!""

Several days later, I received the following email:

""Hello,

This is Etsy's Trust &amp; Safety team.

Your account has been identified as high-risk based on a close review of your account information. For this reason, Etsy has elected to revoke your buying and selling privileges permanently. Etsy reserves the right to close any other accounts you may own as well.

Regardless of your account status, you remain obligated to fulfill any open orders by shipping the items or issuing a full refund.

Please do not open any other accounts on Etsy. They will be closed immediately and without notice.

This decision is final, and we will be unable to respond to any further outreach about your account. This email constitutes our final communication on this matter.

Thank you for your attention to this.

Regards,Etsy Trust and Safety""

I sent a follow-up email inquiring about this suspension to Etsy Trust and Safety (even though they said that decisions were final), and I also sent another support request following this email because I was incredibly confused as to why I was permanently suspended. Etsy never explained why I was suspended in the first place, and I've never bought or sold on Etsy before. It's been three days since my last support request, and I'm concerned that I'll never get an answer as to why this happened. I called Etsy support today and they basically told me that they can't do anything to help me and that my best bet is to email Etsy Trust and Safety, which I already did three days ago. Does anyone have advice because I'm at a loss for what I'm supposed to do?

Etsy,"short and to the point, how do you apply a coupon code (as a customer at checkout) in the etsy app? or can you only use codes on desktop now? 

[these](https://imgur.com/a/CpXrgGe) are the only things i see where i feel like the “apply shop coupon codes” used to be. 

i’ve been an etsy customer for well over a decade so i feel like an idiot lol but i truly can’t see any way to input one which seems like a basic functionality i must be missing. googling only turned up how-tos for the desktop/website experience. i’m on the latest version of both the app &amp; iOS.(buyer question) how to use a coupon code in the app?"
Etsy,"I didn’t even realize that people can see my favorite shops and items until 10 minutes ago. I’ve been a customer for almost 10 years and probably only have two shops listed under my favorites and they’re both really random. Do sellers use that info for anything?

Etsy,"Buyer says the item was what she wanted but knocked off a star due to shipping, even though she admitted it wasn’t my fault....4/5 Star rating due to International Delays, can I get it removed?"
Etsy,"Hey everyone!

I’ve been in business for about two years now. We have been profitable, but not enough to fully rely on the income. We have many sales channels, Etsy being one of them.

On Etsy today, I got a message from my competitors team member saying that my design is against their copywrite and licensing.

I had asked to see the details on their copywrite because my design is a lot different.

To explain this:
Their design is a fingerprint that includes books in the Bible to form the fingerprint. They are hand made, in cursive and are posters (wall art)

My design is a thumbprint that includes EVERY book in the Bible to form a thumbprint. My design has a very distinctive font, design and wording that is totally apart from their design. I also sell my design on shirts (apparel).

With this being said, I understand that the designs sound very similar, but visually the designs are obviously different.

My designer used a custom font and formation for my thumbprint. They obviously have a different designer and a custom font for their fingerprint.

With all this being said, what should I do about this? If I don’t see their copywrite details, how can I be sure any of this is against their terms? I can’t simply just take my competitors word for it and remove my product. 

Any suggestions will be greatly appreciated!Competitor claims my design is against their copywrite."
Etsy,"All my listings use a similar format for the main picture. I've spent months doing trial and error to make one that stands out, informative(cause nobody read description anymore), multipurpose, yet looks stylish and gorgeous. Nothing special, just title and some detail on top and features on the bottom. 

While checking for trends, I've found a new shop with a similar market that copied my style(font, font size, layout, color), similar enough that people will think it was made by me. I know that it wasn't copyrighted, but it kinda pisses me off and I'm afraid that it might fool the customer

Etsy,"Prior to ordering, this seller was very responsive and answered any questions I had about the product I wanted (which was a $1k made-to-order costume that would be ready to ship in 2-3 weeks). After a few weeks of exchanging messages, I told her I would like to order and she assured me that as soon as I purchased, she would start making it right away. Feeling excited and confident from the good reviews, I finally placed the order on 2/15 along with my measurements and custom requests. 

Three days later, I realized there was one more customization that I wanted for the costume, so I messaged her about it. After no immediate response, and fearing that she might've already started working on it, I contacted her on Instagram and apologized for the double message, letting her know that I wanted to message her about my request before it was too late. She replied back saying it was okay and not to worry.

Over a week later, 2/28: I message her on Etsy kindly asking for an update on my order progress. No response.

Week later 3/06: I send her an email kindly asking again for an update on my order, acknowledging she must be busy and that I'm in no rush to receive the order, but that I just wanted to know the status. She messages me back on Instagram apologizing, saying she'll answer me soon and that she doesn't always receive notifs from Etsy. I say no worries, I'll wait. She sees the message but no more response.

3/08: My order was scheduled to dispatch by this day so I message her on Insta, telling her that I know I said I'd wait, but since my order was supposed to ship today, I thought I'd ask her about it. She replies and apologizes again, saying she's been working a lot. She says my order is in progress and sends me a pic, and that she'll send me more photos in a few days. She says she plans on shipping it next week. So basically, she never started on my order right away like she said she would. Regardless, I say no worries, I'm glad to know.  After a few exchanges I ask if tracking is provided. She sees my message but no response, although she continues to post stories promoting new suits she's making and asking ppl to message her if they want to order.

3/10: I become worried that she might misread one of the measurements I gave her (regarding shoe size b/c she is in a different country) so I message her clarifying the measurement, apologizing if I seemed like an annoying customer and thanked her for her patience. Again, she sees the message but no response, yet continues to post multiple stories promoting other new costumes she is making and asking ppl to message her if they want to order.

I definitely don't want to send another message and become that truly mega ""annoying customer"" for sure, so at this point I decided I would just wait and hope she'll ship my items next week as promised so that I won't worry anymore. 

However, it is concerning to me that ever since I made the purchase, her communication has been very inconsistent. I understand things coming up and getting busy, but it kinda rubs me the wrong way that she had the time to post frequently on social media but not take the time to just send back a simple reply. It also bothers me that she didn't tell me my order would be late until I had to ask her myself. I wonder if she still would've reached out had I not messaged her. Am I getting scammed or am I overreacting? This is the first time I've ever had concerns about an Etsy seller even though this person has high ratings. I don't know what to do and I hope I'm just being paranoidLack of communication from 5-star seller"

I messaged them yesterday to let them know but didn't hear back. I messaged again today to see if they would be able to correct it soon or if I should try to find it somewhere else since I do have a date that I need it by.

Etsy,"Hello, I placed an order 1/15/21 that was supposed to ship by Feb 13. It hasn't shipped yet. The seller reached out and told me she didn't have enough materials to make the colors that I wanted and so I asked her what she had on hand- then I picked on a color that she had to get my order faster. 
A day before it was to ship the seller messaged me and said the person she buys supplies from had just shipped the materials and it wouldn't arrive until 2-25-3-1. 
I didn't even catch this until yesterday, I was told she had these things on hand originally. I was taking screen shots just in case and caught it. Ugh.
I asked for an update on 3-4 and she told me the beginning of next week. I messaged her yesterday and she told me tomorrow for sure.
I messaged her today and she told me life has just been really hectic and work has been crazy for her ""she'll get it to me when she can."" She keeps saying things like ""I'm sorry I'm the worst, I've never had an order be so late."" Etc. I know life happens seriously, I get it. My job is so hectic and tedious too...I get it. 

I'm not sure what to even do. I hate to open a case because if she made my item I know she spent alot of time on it but at the same time, I can't even use it for long. That is nobody's fault but I figured it would have been here March 1 at the latest. It was a bunny mobile for my daughters crib...her nickname is bunbun and it was such a sweet mobile. She's going to be crawling soon and I'm sure she'll slap it around when she does, as babies do. I should have probably just not gotten a mobile because I knew I was very late but I was so excited and happy that we had her nursery done after over a year of an entire gut and remodel.

Etsy,"Hey all!

I'm looking for some help. I set up my shop a little less than a month ago, and when I tried to log in yesterday, I was locked out and simply greeted with a banner over the login box that said ""This account has been deactivated."" I checked my email (INCLUDING my spam folder!!), and had not received any kind of communication from Etsy warning me about my shop being deactivated. I sent an email right away, and called customer service. From looking through previous posts on this sub, it looks like I got the same spiel they always give (""This happens to new shops, but another team actually reviews these cases, so you'll have to talk to them about why you were deactivated when they email you, etc.""). I'm just sitting her absolutely puzzled as to why I got deactivated, as I don't seem to meet any of the criteria I've seen cited by etsy or on forums for deactivation. 

\-I make resin jewelry, accessories, and small homegoods (trinket boxes/trays, makeup organizers, things like that), so nothing that could possibly be copywritten (I didn't have any with any images encapsulated-just pigments and dried flowers). 

\-As my shop is all physical items that are made by me, I don't use any production partner. 

\-I believe my shop was ONLY set up with Etsy pay, as I hadn't connected a PayPal account, and my first two deposits had gone to my bank successfully (and both cycles my incoming profits have covered my fees for the week, so they haven't had to withdraw anything from my account). 

\-I have shipped all of my orders from the zip code that I have entered for my account, and every order has shipped in a timely manner (usually even same or next day when I quote 1-3 business days). 

\-I don't use a VPN on any of my devices, and nobody else who uses any of the wifi networks that I've accessed my shop account on have an Etsy shop-just me, so I don't think it's flagging the system for multiple shops.

Looking through previous posts here and on other forums, every other reason I've seen for accounts being shut down with no warning have been debunked in one way or another. Any help is greatly appreciated!!

Etsy,I opened my first case against a seller on March 3rd and escalated it on March 6th since we both agreed to let Etsy decide. I haven’t received anything saying that anyone has viewed my case. I was wondering if anyone knows how long cases usually last until they are resolved. Also does Etsy resolve cases on the weekends or is it only a Monday-Friday thing?How long do cases usually last?
Etsy,"I’ve seen a lot of posts about how poor March has been for traffic and sales, so with that in mind:
I opened a few days ago, posted about 15+ items to start, started an instagram today. Just wanted a general idea of how to go about advertising without annoying people. 
I’ve started posting on relevant subreddits (recommendations welcome for others) and 9GAG, tons more success in terms of interest on 9GAG. 
Does anyone have any other recommendations for places to share my shop?
Thanks guys, I’m very new to this.New to Etsy, would love some advice."
Etsy,"This was super unexpected and random for me, because my shop is only a few months old and most of my sales are from friends &amp; family, but I got a message after an order saying that the customer's daughter will be wearing my earrings in her wedding!! 

When I sent her the earrings, I included a pair of studs that matched the pair she ordered for free because I was so moved and honored and she messaged me last night after they arrived to say thank you and let me know her daughter also wants her bridesmaid to have a pair of my earrings for the wedding and ordered *again!* I was so shocked!!

This is my first \*real\* business and I'm all torn up about it! She said she's going to send me pictures from the wedding and I'm so excited. :) I had to tell someone who would understand how cool this is!Had a customer buy twice and tell me my earrings will be in her daughter's wedding!"
Etsy,Tracking PackagesWell my package finally stared showing as shipped it was already well on its way to me before the tracking was showing up but then stopped again. I’m very confused and a little worried to tell the truth any ideas why this happens ?
Etsy,I only have 5 sales so I'm not sure if it would be relevant to put on my resume.Do any of you put your etsy shop on your resume?
Etsy,"My shop (4 total sales) just got it’s first 5 star review with actual text. It’s an amazing review to me as somebody who not only sells the items I do, but as somebody who has used the type of items I sell (not the ones I send out obviously). Should I thank them for the review? I mean, I’m pretty happy with it.Responding to a Stellar Review"
Etsy,"Long story short, I bought a vintage designer wallet for a reasonable price. (aka, it wasn’t suspiciously cheap and it was around TheRealReal—a designer consignment website—prices). And they sold non-designer vintage items in the mix, so it seemed real.

Then I forgot about it. The seller said it shipped, but wouldn’t give tracking info.

A few weeks later, I check in on the shop and people are saying they were getting a mysterious package from China that had their item, but the shop was supposed to be in California. Thus, the item was a fake. I went to bed, checked the shop the next day, and it’s gone. I got the “Uh no!” message, which is what happens when a shop is deleted.

I have USPS Informed Delivery and get updates for packages, even if it comes from China. No packages from China are on my list.

So I requested a refund via a case because the item was never delivered after a month. I added the note that it seems that the items are fakes and not vintage, based on reviews I saw before the shop was shut down. I waited 3 days for the seller to respond, escalated, and instantly got a refund.

Well, just today, I got a USPS notification of a shipment coming from China. It has to be the wallet. No one else in my house has ordered anything besides Amazon Prime items.

So I am technically getting the item, even if it’s fake. Am I entitled to get all my money back, even if I’m getting a product? Do I need to notify Etsy I’m getting *something*? Even if it’s fake? Is the seller going to hunt down my house and go after me for taking $400 back? 😬

And now I’m hoping that US Customs doesn’t think I’m committing some sort of crime by illegally importing a fake Gucci wallet. Can I really get in trouble for that?

This is stressful!Weird situation where I got a refund via opening a case for never getting an item, but...should I contact Etsy to “refund the refund”?"
Etsy,"So I got my first 2★ review and I'm just sad and disappointed.
The buyer complains about the size and how long the shipping took. The size is in the description so maybe read for a change?? Also please don't tell me my handmade item isn't well made when you don't bother to read anything. 

But more importantly.. I CAN'T CONTROL THE DAMN TIME IT TAKES TO ARRIVE AFTER I SHIPPED IT!? It even arrived in the estimated delivery time??? 21 out of 14-30 days is apparently too much time to arrive overseas. 

I asked etsy for removal because of the shipping thing but they decided it's totally not against policies and obviously it's my fault we're in a pandemic and shipping takes longer.

Not that it matters but I also have an announcement in my shop stating shipping might take longer due to the ONGOING PANDEMIC??? and an extra note when marking as shipped that it may take longer.

Also contacted the buyer and said I'm sorry he's not satisfied with his order but that I shipped it after a day and everything after isn't in my control and mentioned the other aspects are found in the description. Didn't get a reply after a week. Etsy says it's fine. I'm disappointed.Thanks for nothing, Etsy support"
Etsy,"Every once in a while I get messages from other sellers asking how I make my products/where I source. I never now how to respond. Today, I got a message from a fellow seller that said “Hi! I have a small business and want to start making resin keychains. The initial ones you make are gorgeous! How do I start making these?” 

My issue is I’m also a small business owner, those keychains are one of my best sellers. And are my own unique design. Now, I’m also for empowering others and we can all eat. But it feels so wrong to teach others how to make my own products.

Etsy," ***Anyone Having Tracking Label problems? Please read!!!***

So, I ship out a LOT out of my shop, via the USPS. Besides all the *'late'* and *'huge delays'* the USPS is having, I was also having an *EXTREMELY frustrating,* random issue with packages, *not arriving*, and customers asking where they were.

So, upon checking the tracking, the package's tracking would show up as ***""Pre-Shipment - Shipping label created. USPS Awaiting Item.""***

**???**

This ""Pre-Shipment"" status would be on a package that I had **CLEARLY** mailed, inside the Post Office, **WEEKS AGO**.  Why was it saying *""USPS Awaiting Item??""*  
 

Very frustrating, as the item would *not show up to my customer*, and I would have to send out a replacement *100% at my own expense,* over and over.

I felt like I was playing '*Russian Roulette'* when I would drop off multiple items at the post office, because *some* would go to the destination  they were supposed to, and *some would not show up*. So, when questioned by a customer, I would of course, just check tracking, see ***""Pre-Shipment-USPS awaiting Item""*** .....and I knew it was 100% lost. Mail out another one for Free.  
 

So, I went to my local post office today, to ask about it.  


After 45 minutes of investigation, we figured it out. The USPS was baffled at first, because they *swear* that *every package gets scanned*, and released, and there should be *no reason that random ones* would not be scanned, or why they were coming up as the Post Office was waiting for it.  
 

Heres what is supposed to happen:

When we 'print' a ETSY Shipping label, three things should happen:  
 1) We generate a label, electronically generating a number, let's say it's *: #000001*  
 2) Etsy Generates an electronic ***""Package Manifest""*** that *matches our Label Number*, *000001*, and transmits it to the USPS  
  3) The USPS , when they receive our package, and scan it, the software  looks for *#000001*, matches it, and creates the record, tracking, in the system, and it's a *""live package"".*  
 

But, what's happening is, Step #2) in the procedure, *(The ETSY transmittal of the Electronic Manifest)* is being delayed, by ETSY's software, sometimes by a few days. So....  
 

 1) You create your label &amp; drop off to USPS the next day  
 2) But, ***NO Package Manifest is sent to the USPS*** *until up to 3 days later!*  
 3) USPS receives your package, scans it, and into the bin it goes.  
 

However, when it starts to get sorted later, and electronic manifests start matching packages, **YOURS**  has ***NO 'matching"" ETSY package manifest,*** that allows it to be tracked, because ETSY delayed the sending of it, and now, when it's scanned, *(which can NOT be detected by the person scanning it)* your package is an *""orphan""*.   


It has No tracking number...to the system, it *'doesn't exist'* and it apparently goes into a black hole, because these packages ***have NEVER shown up to the people waiting for them***, causing me to have to resend them, at 100% my expense &amp; loss.  
 

**It's a 100% ETSY problem.**   


Today, *(3/9/21)* I brought *7 items* to mail, *(before we figured this out)*, because I wanted to make sure they were scanned in my presence. **AFTER** we  had figured this issue out, the Postmaster went and got my 7 packages that were ***ALREADY SCANNED earlier***,  to do a Manifest Matching search on the software, *as a test.*    


*ONE of the 7 labels* I printed out ***THIS MORNING*** did ***NOT*** have a corresponding Package Manifest sent from ETSY!!!!  
 

He then showed me printouts of the 6 **correct scanned** packages, *(that had the 1/2/3 steps that I mentioned earlier)*. 

***The 7th*** was missing a section, #2, ***the Package Manifest Transaction Number that ETSY generates***.   


This happened right in front of my eyes.  
 

So, he handed me back my tube and said ""Uhhh...That one, is not going anywhere,  You need to buy a new label, and you need to tell ETSY"".   
 

So, at least I know. But, as of today, March 9th, 2021, ***I CANNOT trust labels created by ETSY anymore***.   


I'm going to have to copy addresses and go to the **USPS Click n' Ship**, because I **cannot trust  Etsy** to make 100% guaranteed shippable labels.   
 

This is now a huge pain in the a\*\*, but, I can't afford to keep repackaging and re-shipping out my posters for free to people who don't get their items due to Etsy's software issues. It's costing me too much money.  
 

FYI - *this all started in 2021, January*. I have *had NO issues like this in the prior 3 years*, and I ship a LOT.  
 

Anyway, I wanted to let anyone know, who was having a similar issue.

Etsy,"So is it okay for me to request a refund from someone who wants more money on top of the original price they quoted me after I've paid them, regardless of whether or not they do refunds? I'm just irked this seller didn't factor in the additional payment fees and they're ignoring the fact I did indeed send the amount we agreed on and because they didn't get the full amount (due to a small percentage being removed for payment services), they want me to send x amount more. They also don't seem to understand the fact that more fees will be extracted from x amount if I send it, meaning they'll have to ask for more money yet again.

They seem very nice, but idk. This just doesn't look like good business practice. When the seller makes a slip up, isn't it their responsibility to take care of it instead of wanting the buyer to do it?Okay to request refund?"

Etsy,"Hi everyone, it would be really great if I can get some guidance from sellers who are located in Germany.

My wife recently opened an Etsy store. She's trying to sell some of her digital designs. She's also registered as a ""small business owner"" with the help of a Steuerberater and got her Steuernummer (which I assume is tax ID) (we've just moved to Germany btw). But now we're learning some new stuffs that we are obligated to state, write, etc in her Etsy page. So we would be most grateful if you could shed some lights to the topics below.

\- Registering to Lucid: I assume this is related to physical products, right? Some people said we should check it out but we're only selling downloadable files. 

\- ODR regulation: My question would be, is it compulsory? If not, do you advise for us to register? For digital products I am not sure if any dispute comes since the prices are quite low. But what do you think?

\- Imprint, terms and conditions, cancellation policy, privacy policy: We've seen so few stores that uploads these documents. Is it compulsory for Germany based stores? If it is, should they be carefully written? Like should we hire some consultant for it?

\- VAT ID: I'm really confused about all the ID's that we have. We thought Steuernummer would be enough but in Etsy there's a place for VAT ID certification upload. As far as I understand we can apply for it but why it is necessary and why it is something ""additional"" we didn't get.

\- Invoices: This is something we both feel stupid... How can we extract all the fees that Etsy charges us as an ""invoice"" so that we can show it as expense? Or are we required to do something like this? Maybe ""monthly statements csv"" is enough? I feel lost for all these invoice and declaration stuff. And probably this is not a Germany-related question... But here it goes.

Etsy,"I read that they charge 0.20 per listing. If you have multiple items for that same listing they charge 0.20 each time it sells.

Etsy,"Hi everyone!

I have a question about a recent etsy purchase I did so hope this is the correct place!

I recently purchased a large item from an Etsy shop. These are custom items made to size and are not cheap (mine was about $500 with shipping) I emailed the seller before I purchased asking what size I should get and they told me so that's the size I ordered. When it came in I thought it was a little large but had read other reviews that had similar comments of receiving a larger size than ordered. So I thought okay maybe this is common and it's not that bad I can probably make it work. It was obviously not ideal and definitely harder to work with due to size difference. I was very hesitant to message them though due to the extreme cost of shipping and like I said I had seen other reviews so I thought this was common.  The product is unique and this is my first time using this item and purchasing one.

So I use it maybe three times outside and it gets a little dirty (as it's used outside). The seller messages me and says that I received the wrong product that my product was shipped to someone else and I got theirs which is why it's too big. The seller asked if I could ship mine to the person who got mine and they would ship theirs to me. I said I would love to do that as it really is too big for me, and I told them I want to let you know that I used mine a few times and they asked for a pic so I sent one.

The seller said they would get back with me and a couple of days passed so I followed up and they told me to keep mine since I used it and that I should have measured it before use (which I told them about the other reviews I had seen about theirs coming big). I asked if there was any way that I could still get that one and I would ship the bigger one I received back to them.

The issue now is that to ship it back where I bought it versus where my new one was sent is very expensive due to location distances (with the original sellers being much more than the person who got mine by mistake). 

I'm vague with the product but think of an athletic type item. If I ship it back I know the seller will be able to refinish it and it would essentially be like new.

Please know that I'm not trying to be difficult or unreasonable but definitely would prefer the correct size I ordered as it's already made for me and the seller admitted this is their error I received the wrong product. I'm asking the seller if there's anything else that can be done but was looking for any other input. 

Thank you!Received Wrong Custom Item"

Etsy,"Hi! I have a small shop on Etsy, as in I just hit 250 sales this week. My shop sells tees and sweatshirts and such. Given that I'm a small shop, I don't have a huge in-house stock of blank items to press my designs on to, so as orders come in, I purchase the shirts through a wholesale site. It usually takes 3-4 days for me to get the shirt and I make the customer's items usually the day I get the shirt or the day after. So my typical turnaround time is about a week. As such, my shop's processing time states 1-2 weeks. 

I haven't had an issue with this until the last 2 days or so, when I've gotten 3 separate customers messaging me asking me when their items will ship. One customer had a ship by date of 3/11 and the other 2 are due to ship by 3/16...so neither is late/overdue.

Etsy,"About a month ago I received a message from an international buyer stating that their order had not arrived. This was only about 2 weeks after I had shipped their order and with the current world environment we all know that unless you are sending courier parcels overseas are taking between 4-6 weeks with standard mail - which is what they chose. It is worth mentioning that I send via untracked mail (but do offer upgraded shipping that includes tracking). Note: For those that are about to flame and say ""you should always send tracked mail"" - I get the risk here so please save your breath. 

I gave the customer the usual reply stating these facts and they replied that all was well and that they would wait. 

Fast forward about a week and I wake up to a case being filed against me for non-delivery. Since Etsy basically backs you into a corner to refund the person I just ate the loss and refunded them after a few days.

Today I got another order from the same person. They did not opt for tracked shipping.

What should I do? Honestly the person was not malicious when they filed a case and there may be some language barrier (they are from Italy). I feel like I should just cancel and refuse to send it unless they pay for tracked shipping. But what about the other items that they probably just kept?

The person messaged me letting me know that they have a haul account page and would be interested in me sending them some of my products for PR purposes. Having launched a new line of products and the amount of followers that ""MadisonHaulss"" has, I was very interested. 

Three weeks after sending the package, I messaged Madison on Instagram about if my package had been received and when I could expect a haul with unfortunately no message returned. I then last week followed up with the person via Etsy with no response. Last night I was fed up &amp; checked Madisons Tik Tok account to see if she had posted my haul, this is when I found a video where she addressed the situation that someone was claiming to be her on Etsy. I felt very foolish as this is not something I would expect to fall for, but did in the moment as I was excited to have someone promote my brand to such a large following. 

I just wanted to warn other Etsy sellers of this scam and to make sure you don't fall for this same stunt!

Etsy,"Last night I typed into the search bar a couple of my products to find where they are sitting in the search results for customers, during this process I found ***not one, not two, but EIGHT*** shops using my photographs to market their products. I take all of my lay flat photos on my branded tissue paper, as well as my online mock ups of other colours with my branding in the background. Not a single one of these shops took the time to alter, crop or remove any of my branding from the photos. ***If you're going to steal - do better, be better.*** 

I have messaged all of the shops and here are some of the responses I have received. 

* ""Sorry about that, done""
* ""I'm sorry, your photo is really nice for my item, but I'm worried changing the photo will prevent Etsy from letting me receive my money, I will delete your photo on 8/3 after receiving money.  
We hope you agree.""
* ""Due to technical errors we have removed the copyright of your image. Thank you very much""

I am not totally sure how a technical error has caused you to steal and promote my photos, but okay? In addition, 3 of the accounts that got back to me just cropped my branding out of the background and left the item photo. This is very disappointing to say the least. 

I have been on Etsy for just about a year now, so honestly I am a little flattered that people want to steal my product images \**hair flip\*.* I saw this happening to other shops around Christmas time and was curious to how people have the audacity to blatantly rip off other peoples designs. I am so curious to what the product looks like if someone actually orders from them? Specifically if they saw my branding and thought they were ordering from me, this could be very bad for my brand overall! 

I have given all of the sellers 24 hours to remove the photographs &amp; then will be filling trademark reports with Etsy directly. 

Does anyone have any experience dealing with sellers like this? Some of the accounts are very clearly all stolen photos with no consistency of branding or photo style. Any advice would be helpful! Thanks!Etsy Sellers stealing my stores photos!"

Etsy,"Hello,

I ordered a custom item (designed upon my request) that was also personally sized from an international seller, and paid several hundred dollars.  The item is fantastic, with one small flaw: the seller crafted the item about 10% larger than I specified, and this was enough to make the item unwearable (it slips off).  I'm not innocent in this, though, because I measured my sizing too generously as well.  However, had the item been crafted as I specified, it would have been larger than desirable but still wearable.

I just want the item to fit right, so I asked the seller to resize it and haven't heard back yet.  The seller seems like a fantastic person so I think they'll be fine doing that.  To sweeten the pot, I offered to pay the shipping out to them, and I didn't mention the shipping back out to me.  I'm hoping they'll offer to cover that, but if not, I'll pay that too.  It's going to cost me out the nose, but I like the seller's work.  I just want it to fit right.

I wanted to get opinions on whether this was a reasonable request, and if so, how it should be set up.  I figured I'd ship it back using USPS's Priority Mail International with full insurance coverage.  I've been messaging the seller through Etsy, both because that's my only point of contact and because it keeps things documented.  Would a request like this need to go through Etsy's sales or customer service system at all, perhaps as a return/rebuy?  Anything I haven't thought of?

Etsy,For background to the story I sell signs in my shop. My bestseller is a wood sign that says “new home new beginning new memories est. 20xx”. I got a message today from another shop owner claiming I copied her “original design” and wants me to take it down or she will contact Etsy. While our signs say the same thing so do thousands of other signs. So I doubt she has a copyright/trademark on the phrase. Also the fonts I use on my sign are allowed for commercial use and are different than the ones she uses. So while they do look similar (both have the same words with mixed script and non script fonts) they are not exactly alike.  To add to that my sign the words are painted on and hers is a vinyl decal. Does she have a chance of getting Etsy to take down my listing?  Any advice would be so helpful. Thanks so much!!Need advice!

Etsy,"I just got a notice that USPS adjusted one of my labels; I sold two very lightweight cloth masks. I purchased the label through Etsy, and based on the weight (1.6oz) it should have shipped as a First Class package. I had the package type as a ""package/thick envelope"" as I always do, since I use polymailers for these items.

My email notifying me of the adjustment stated the weight was adjusted to 2oz, and that the USPS classified it as ""Envelope	USPS Flat Rate Small Envelope"". They billed me an additional $4.37 on top of the $3.03 I already paid for the label. The shipping for the labels ($7.40) is almost the same price as the items the customer bought.

I left a five star review because the product was good, but I stated they shouldn't be listing these as handmade. They aren't making a crazy profit but I started out selling stickers and I know how small the profit margins are, so it really bugged me. 

How do you guys feel about this?How do you feel about all of these Aliexpress re-sellers?"

Etsy,"They're in India, I'm in the US, the other customer is in Europe. They messaged me before my order was ready to ship, and wanted me to send the wrong item to the other customer. They said they would pay me back shipping, but I told them I would only be able to send it if they sent me a prepaid label, not just the address.

They agreed to that, but my order finally showed up and it's just the address. I am not comfortable with putting my money on the line and also it's tough for me to get out and ship things, and I don't have a printer, which I told them.

This whole order has been tough, because they made completely the wrong thing, communication was difficult, but I was willing to accept their custom creation out of curiousity. They kept on telling me they would ship mine that day, but didn't until a week later. We agreed on them sending me a prepaid label that I would just have to attach to the package and drop in the mail. But then they didn't.

So I don't know what else I can do. Also, when I looked up shipping to try to estimate for them, it's more than my whole order even cost.Advice needed: Seller sent me another customer's order"

Has anyone had this happen before? What should I do? Can anyone help me see if my tracking number is legit? Thank you in advance!

Etsy,"Please research shipping related points before you start selling on etsy. This includes, but is not limited to:

\- Where to get packing materials

\- How to pack your products safely and cost effective (that includes box and envelope sizes !)

\- How to buy shipping labels

\- Which countries you are comfortable shipping to (i.e. you know how to ship there, that also includes how to fill out customs forms)

\- How much shipping your products to certain destinations cost

I've seen way too many posts lately where people are like: ""I just made a sale, can someone please tell me how to ship my item now"". 

It's normal to learn from mistakes and improve as you go, but please please please PLEASE do as much research as you can before you start selling, and how to ship your products is something you need to have sorted out before you put anything up for sale.Friendly reminder for new sellers"

Etsy,"Hello.

A woman recently contacted me asking if she was able to get a coupon code because she was willing to buy 5 listings from me. I felt grateful and gave her a 10% coupon code. My prices are pretty cheap as is and I do offer free shipping on orders over $35 but I didn’t think of it at the time so I just sent her the coupon. Two days later I got an order from her and she only bought 2 listings, instead of the 5 she said she would.

I kinda feel outplayed, but at the same time I feel like I shouldn’t feel this way as I’m supposed to feel grateful that someone bought from my shop? Should I have just offered free shipping if she went over $35 instead? What should I do next time so this doesn’t happen?Customer asking for coupon codes."

Etsy,"I am trying to drop ship some artwork that I made but I have a lot of questions. For clarification, I'm using Printify, but I'm having trouble figuring out:

1. What items to sell. I love the idea of posters, framed, canvases, and giclee, but I don't know WHICH items to sell for each. Even more frustrating is which poster variation I should sell. There's:

* Posters
* Premium Posters
* Premium matte posters
* Giclee art print

I really want to have a quality product, but it's hard knowing the quality without spending lots of money for a bunch of samples. Can anyone vouch for the quality of these products? Maybe buying samples are really my only option?

I'm also cautious about clogging up my store page adding a whole lot of variations, eg 1 artwork, 3 different listings with a:  Poster variation, Framed Varation, and Canvas Variation. Unfortunately, I was trying to integrate all 3 products into one listing, but Printify wouldn't be able to automatically grab orders.  So the question is if I should those variations or stick to one product?

2)  Pricepoint. I plan to sell \~7 different sizes for each product, but I was looking at the cost for shipment, and it was around $5-13. Is it better for the buyer to each up the cost or offer free shipping? I don't really want it to dig into my costs too much, but I've seen other sellers offer free shipping and it seems to be a really attractive feature.People who sell dropshipped posters from Printify, do you have any advice for navigating the ecosystem of selling your prints?"
Etsy,"Recently a customer purchased a ring from my shop, but left me a 3 star review because she ordered the wrong ring. The text she left was actually really kind, however the stars do not align with what she said. She mentions how she accidentally bought the wrong ring, but she loved it and would be ordering more. She even complimented the free stickers that I give out. I’m kind of confused on what to do here since it’s not my fault she ordered the wrong ring. I messaged her saying I would give her a coupon for 50% off the ring if she wanted to repurchase the correct one, but I feel like I should’ve just reported it because now I’m losing money for a mistake that had nothing to do with me.

I’ve been mailing my art prints using untracked letter mail so far to Canada, US and international. However with covid everything is delayed and I want to add Tracking for my customers for some peace of mind. I mail through Canada post and saw two options:

1. International registered mail - the person at the post office said this comes with tracking but from what I’ve read online it doesn’t? (For international orders)

2. Tracked packet - I believe I can print the shipping labels directly off Etsy or Canada post site &amp; apply the small business discount?

Any thoughts on which service I should use?

Etsy,"So I’m planning on selling my homemade paint. I’m in the process of figuring out a ‘recipe card’ so people can understand how pigment &amp; creating paint works. I have the measurements for the ingredients, but it’s only based on using gum Arabic as a binder to complete the paint, which I was planning on including to make it simpler for people to make the paint right away, and not have to go out and buy a binder.

But I’m wondering if I should include a binder to be added to the paint, because after adding a binder, it just needs water, which everyone has access to, and not everyone has access to paint binders like; gum Arabic (what I would sell along with my pigment), honey, acrylic polymer, alkyd polymer, epoxy polymer, egg yolk, etc. I mean there’s so many options. 

If you were to buy paint pigment, would you appreciate/prefer most of the ingredients to make the paint be included? Or would you prefer to create your own recipe for it?I create natural pigment for making my own paint. Paint requires a binder, which there are many options for. Would you think it would be helpful to include a binder with the pigment that I’m going to sell? Or should I let others use/buy their own binder?"

Etsy,"So I came across this lady selling crystals on etsy. Gigantic clusters of rose quartz (like huge) at such a decent price, and with free shipping to Canada ( from the US.). She messaged me thanking her for being one of her first sales (she had like 9 sales i think). I replied to her thanking her for allowing me to find her business. Then she send me a picture of the receipt from USPS and it was 55.00 for the shipping alone, the crystal was 46 dollars CAD. She sent the photo of the receipt and said ""im new at this whole shipping thing"". I didnt really know what to say but instantly replied and ask was this the cost JUST to ship it alone? And she replied: 

Yes I already sent it. And yes, that’s what it cost. I hadn’t seen you were in Canada until it was too late. My boyfriend is making fun of me. Lol. It cost me $20 to give a away my crystal.

I guess the shipping cost outweigh the item cost so it is essentially her giving away her crystal. Im not sure even what to reply. Honestly I wish she would have asked me to pay the shipping fee before sending it out, and then i may have paid it but likely would have told her that its a bit too expensive and to cancel my order and id say the reason was that I bought it by mistake so she didn't get penalized and that way she could've sold it to someone locally and made a profit, and simply left the post office after them telling her it was 55 dollars to ship and consolidating me first. It was nice of her to send it anyway and not expect anything because after all I bought it at an advertised price. The tracking says its currently in transit. Im not sure what I should do. Pay the shipping? Help😭😭😭Feeling kind of guilty, any advice?"
Etsy,Has anyone come across this weird phenomenon when selling on Etsy? I have a few best sellers that are just small tabletop signs that can be customized with any saying the buyer wants. We sell them for $20 and we sell multiple a day and its great. If I put them on sale for say 15% or 20% off we probably sell 1 a day sometimes none a day. This happened again because we were doing absolutely no sales in February so we did an entire store sale just to hopefully drive some sales with etsy ads and it did product some income but then the sale ended and we have sold 15 of them in 2 days....

I just started my etsy shop earlier this year and so far have had 12 sales, which im suuuuper stoked about. I haven’t yet had any reviews - (my first sale i estimate arrived to the buyer mid February)

I noticed Etsy has quite a gap between the purchase date to when the customer can leave a review.. How does this work? I.e is there a set time period for this gap? How do you promote reviews when it seems to not be an option for buyers to leave a review right after receiving the order?

Etsy,"I had a buyer give me a one star review because the costume she purchased did not fit her friend's pet and now I'm debating whether I should publicly respond to their review. 

They messaged me before purchasing and gave me their pet's measurement. When I am asked what size they should order I always tell them to order to their shortest length because if they order to the longest length the costume slips off their pet and the costumes can only be made round. I described my own pets measurement so it's more clear. I also attached a link to a video so that they can ensure that they actually measure their pet right. I have had people guess or measure with a flat ruler which always throws off their actual measurements. I provide pictures of how the pet should be measured in every one of my listing photos. My FAQ and listing descriptions all state where these can be found and how to measure as well as with what to measure. I list in my FAQ that I do not accept returns or exchanges for these costumes (I can't resell them because they request the size they need and they are made to order) but I offer a small discount if the buyer measured incorrectly. I make them to the size they order and they are always measured before being sent out so for them to tell me that it's not the size they ordered rather upset me. If I made a mistake I will fix it which is why I always ask for a picture of the costume being measured. 

This is the review they left me:

""Product is very cute and definitely looks like a donut. Unfortunately, I had first contacted the owner about making sure I got the correct sizing and she responded with vague instructions on how to measure the tortoise. Whenever I received the item, it was much smaller than I expected (and smaller than the requested 4x4) and I'm not even able to use it. I contacted the owner and she told me there aren't any refunds allowed but she would give me 10% off to order yet another one to try and get the size right. I feel that this shop could provide a quality product if they got the sizing right and if the customer service was better.""

I did not respond to the review but rather sent them a message:

""Good evening, I apologize that you were not pleased with your product. Please note that I offered everything possible as to how your shelled friend is to be measured. This included pictures in the listings as well as a video showing exactly how they are to be measured with a soft measuring tape. If this is too vague I would appreciate what would best help you in regards to how your shelled friend is measured. I am always happy to receive suggestions on how to improve. 

I also requested a picture of the costume received to be measured to ensure the measurement. If you could please provide me with that I would be glad to assist you in creating a new costume that fits your shelled friend.""

I did not receive a response from them but at this point I doubt I will receive one. Would it be best to reply or just ignore it? Thank you for your help and advice!To Respond or Not Respond?"
Etsy,"I know there are apps/services that transfer your images, descriptions, etc. Over to Shopify and was looking for suggestions from anyone that has used one of those services. My biggest concern is the image quality. All of our pictures are high quality but we have over 500 listings and it would be extremely time consuming to upload each listing individually.

For those of you wondering we are a shop that offers personalized products not some drop ship guru wannabe with a ton of listings.

Etsy,"I'm wanting to start my own bumper sticker business. I can't seem to find any good outsourcing companies that fit within my small budget. Competition sells similar sized/quality stickers at about $6 including shipping, but if I spend $2 on a sticker and $2 on shipping that leaves me with a $2 profit on a design I spent 15+ hours on. I suppose this could be profitable as a side business but I want this to be my full-time job. I have a $25 inkjet printer so printing quality isn't bad, but it isn't great.

I know Etsy isn’t like Poshmark in that social media sense, but I’m curious if it’s at least similar in the way of they favorite shops that post new things often.

Etsy,"I recently bought a dress from an Etsy seller that was labelled as handmade - they had great reviews and the seller was kind in helping me find my size. 
However, when the item arrived the tag immediately gave me alarm bells and a quick google of the brand took me to Amazon where the dress is £6 cheaper.
Thankfully I bought it on sale so only ended up paying £2 more than I should’ve, and I know I should’ve done more research.
But my question is - is this allowed? I don’t think it’s dropshipping as the seller did repackage it (although it wasn’t personalised, just put into another box and wrapped in paper).
I’m going to tell people in my review that I recommend going through Amazon and I also won’t be returning it as I would have to pay for shipping (it’s also a nice dress...)
I just feel like I’ve been tricked. I wasn’t gullible enough to think it was handmade - I thought it was obvious they got it elsewhere. Still, I paid a lot of money (at least for me being lower class) so I feel cheated.

Edit* it is the same seller on amazon. However their name does not match the tag and I feel they are reselling an item from elsewhere on both sites.
Another edit* apparently it is made by their sister company which explains the name on the tag. Although it’s not handmade I feel they don’t violate Etsy’s guidelines. I feel guilty for not buying a true handmade product and will be more careful in future. I’m sorry.Seller repackaged an Amazon item"

Etsy,"Hey everyone! I am heavily considering taking down my shop. It wasn’t until around this past fall &amp; Christmas time that I started having some serious issues with customers, Etsy being unhelpful and USPS in general. I deal with some considerable health issues and cannot work but make the items in my Etsy shop as a therapeutic hobby that happens to sell on a very small scale every now and then which has been really wonderful while I wait for some form of assistance. But this has turned into something way too frustrating if I’m being honest. 

Some background: I just had my very first package be destroyed by USPS before Christmas. It was to no fault of myself and was very obviously someone not paying attention and throwing or maybe even stomping on the box, or so it looked like when the buyer sent me images. What the buyer and I agreed upon was filing a claim to have the cost reimbursed (I only send my fragile items with priority as the absolute minimum shipping service) as there wasn’t really enough time for them to get a replacement from me in time to gift it. They ended up filing it themselves to get their money back because it was easier for them to handle it and bring it in to their local USPS because they ask to inspect it before they cut you a check. I would have done it for the customer but I didn’t have the item in question or the packaging and we obviously weren’t going to send it back to me to handle it, if that makes sense.

Just now I had my 2nd sale since Christmas time and I packaged the item up nicely and shipped it out as I have always done. I package my items VERY carefully because they are framed butterflies and they go behind glass. I also always send a photo to the customer before sending to verify everything is in good space. The client just got their butterfly in the mail today and what do you know? The frame has a stab/impression mark in it. I am not sure how this happened from transit since it is such a small hole/stab mark but unless the person did it themselves (which I believe to be highly unlikely), then this is obviously damage from USPS despite all of my packaging and fragile stickers. The frame was brand new before I sent it out I literally opened it that day and checked it over a bunch of times. My only issue here is that the photo I sent of it to prove its condition and verify the item with the buyer somehow JUST cropped the very top few centimeters of the frame which just so happens to be where the mark is! Fantastic! 

I am worried the customer thinks I sent it to them like that intentionally or if this leads for some reason to an Etsy case, Etsy will not be helpful to me. I do offer exchanges as long as they are in good faith/appropriate timing. Since they just received it a few hours ago I obviously have no problem with this and I apologized and asked them if they would like to exchange it for a brand new one which OR we can go about a USPS claim. 

[ Side note: I am honestly worried about my reviews at this point which were officially kind of ruined after Christmas by a lunatic that wanted their money back and admitted there was nothing wrong with their item, just that they were dealing with financial issues due to COVID and it being after x-mas they had no money. I had no issues with my items or customer service up until this point and had all 5 stars, this review was extortion and my first 1 star. Etsy ended up siding with me in the end but refunded the buyer out of their own pocket which is obnoxious and encourages this behavior on the platform. ]

But anyways dealing with another headache like this is not what I want to be doing right now. I am pretty over all of the stress brought with the responsibility of owning an Etsy shop and having to trust USPS to be careful with fragile packages and make it right for people even if the damage isn’t my fault. I quite literally just dealt with some weird person from the UK harassing me over messages non-stop yesterday and I had to refuse the sale from them so not to get involved with a Karen. I would mostly like to settle this current frame dent issue (about the size of a knife tip or ballpoint pen) and then just close out my shop completely. 

My question is what should I do from here to ensure a good customer service job on my end and make this customer happy? I can’t really afford to shell out the full cost of the item to refund it and send a new one free of charge. That’s a ton of materials, time &amp; a lot of money for me at this time. I’m sure they don’t want to keep it because the dent bothers them as it would anyone. Do I just stay firm and ask that they return it to me and I’ll send a brand new one? Should I stay on the USPS route and have them purchase a new one once reimbursed and they can keep the broken one? I am not sure at this point is the right thing to do. I am not sure if I will return to Etsy or not at any point in the future after this. I hope this doesn’t sound like whining as I’m sure a lot of you guys deal with much bigger shops/constant clients and stuff and deal with this on a much larger scale. But I’ve only made under 60 sales and I’ve been on Etsy for well over a year and this isn’t easy for me or good for my health condition which is related to trauma and stress. 

Sorry for kind of ranting, thank you guys.Losing my mind with USPS/Etsy"
Etsy," I have an Instagram page where I promote my jewelry and I engage with my customers and other seller and even made a few friends, I made a group chat with a few sellers and we all share tips on selling and help each other out with sales and boost each other’s posts and help with questions etc. I created a certain bracelet that’s gotten really popular and I’ve made many sales from it, other sellers who also make bracelets are asking where I got the beads from or ask me for links. I don’t feel like it’s appropriate to give them that information, I normally don’t gate keep and I’m very open with sharing where I get certain products but I feel like I should maybe draw the line when it comes to what I’m selling cause it doesn’t make sense to share that information. I also noticed a few of the other sellers copy a lot of the things I do I normally don’t care but it’s getting a bit annoying. 

I know of some sellers who make others pay for their vendor list. For me I would rather not share it. I already shared with another seller who asked me and she was a bit rude about it and learned my lesson. Am I wrong for this? please let me know. And if I’m right what should I answer them when they ask without being rude? 
Thanks

Etsy,"Hello! 

I sell stationery on Etsy and I have transitioned to no tracking order to all of my orders being tracked. I used to sell my sticker packs with free shipping, so all orders placed would be sent out with a stamped envelope. This did not work out well as almost 10 of my orders shown up missing just as of last month. I can’t track the order so I can’t tell if it’s delayed, lost, or the customer simply scammed me. Of course, according to the customer, I have either refunded or replaced said item, however being a small business, I can’t afford to do this anymore. I know that if an item is deemed lost, then the shop owner is responsible for it but I don’t feel as if it’s fair that I have to pay for USPS’ mishaps. Since I found no other advice, I updated my shop so that all of my orders are tracked as of recently but unfortunately, my traction has gotten lower due to the fact that I added tracked shipping only. 

Since I sell domestically, tracking does not go over $4. However if I do sell stickers then I don’t know if customers would think it’s worth it to buy something that’s equal to the shipping price.

I feel like I’m asking for the obvious but I can’t seem to find other help elsewhere. Is no tracking worth it? Should I go back to offering free shipping and get many customers or offer tracked shipping only and get little to no traction?Is no tracking worth it?"

I explained to the customer that my shop was supposed to have been on vacation and gave him the option of a refund, or a slight delay in shipping. Either way, is this something that I need to worry about happening after my baby is born? There's no way that after a c-section I'm going to want to get a surprise order.

Etsy,"After Etsy started using Asendia, I had a bad experience with an international package being stuck in limbo for a long time without updated tracking info.

Etsy,"I have a sticker store. Most of my stickers are $3-4 and I ship them first class letter mail due to them being so light so that I can offer free shipping for my customers. Customers can choose to upgrade to tracked shipping if they want to for approximately $3, but most don't unless they're placing a big order.

This buyer in particular placed an order in the beginning of February. I shipped out the order. Two weeks-ish later, they contact me to say it hasn't arrived. Etsy's dismal letter tracking also shows it hasn't yet arrived, it stopped in a city along the way and tracking hasn't updated since. I send out another order since they only ordered one thing, I'm willing to pay out of pocket to try it again, so I confirm with the buyer that the address is correct and ship again. Another two weeks go by and they say that it still hasn't arrived (Going from Seattle to Texas). They want me to ship out a third order with tracking. At this point after sending the second one free, I went from profit to breaking even, at this point sending out a third, especially with the cost of tracked package, I'm going to be paying them to take it.

I'm tempted to cut my losses and say I am unable to continue to attempt to fill the order, refund the buyer, and apologize that USPS seems to be incapable of finding their address, but what would you all do? I don't know if they're saying they didn't arrive because they want multiples which would be odd because my stuff is pretty cheap, but I can't afford to keep sending out orders to an address that clearly doesn't seem to be working.

I offer tracked shipping if people want to pay for it but I don't want to force it due to the fact it would double my buyers' costs. I've had about 250 orders in my shop so far, this is the first one that hasn't arrived.When would you just cut your losses and just refund a buyer?"

Etsy,"I am switching over to craftybase for my bookkeeping after finding that neither quickbooks nor godaddy were going to work well for me without a whole lot of extra work. 

I work in mixed media and have figured out how to track pretty much everything else except for junk jewelry. Some of it I get for free, some of it I buy in lots off of ebay. Thank god it's not something I use a ton of, but many of my pricier pieces incorperate it or are made out of it almost entirely. I could go by the piece but most of it gets totally deconstructed and used part by part. I could go by weight, but even pieces made totally out of junk jewelry have weight added from adhesives and stuff, and sometimes parts are removed and discarded as well. Also some pieces are made with some new components and some junk jewelry. To make it more complicated, the lots I have gotten have included inexpensive costume stuff, vintage stuff, and sterling silver/semiprecious stones. I charge more for pieces that incorperate vintage, silver, and gems compared to the items that don't. Like a lot more sometimes. 

At this point, since I spent so little on it last year, I'm considering just adding it as a non-inventoriable expense and then just not including it in COGS data. But at least for going forward, what kinds of workable systems have others worked out?How in the hell are you supposed to track COGS when you purchase materials is huge mixed lots?"

Half of my brain is telling me that the seller found a good deal and is now selling it for market price. The other half is telling me that the seller is going to rip someone off.  I'm new to Etsy (having only bought a shirt and mug)...and have never made a large purchase.  The seller has 75 positive reviews and almost a perfect rating...but has no return policy as far as I can tell.  

Any thoughts/ advice.  I am IN LOVE with this ring, but don't want to pay $400 for a $90 piece of junk that looks nice in the photos.Thinking about buying very marked up (320%) jewelry form a seller with good reviews. Thoughts?"
Etsy,"I got 3 orders in a row with incomplete or weird addresses that I couldn't find on Google maps. I usually contact the customer when this happens and double check I got everything right.
One in particular was an international address and the customer says she got it right. It's a $3 product sent from the US to the UK as a letter with international stamps (so no tracking). I say the odds of her getting her purchase are 60%.What's the standard procedure when a customer provides the wrong address?"
Etsy,"I see a lot of people complaining about receiving packages beyond delivery estimated time. Yes, it’s frustrating to purchase something and have it arrive beyond your purchase or holiday. However, leaving negative reviews on the shop/product is just you being a jerk. 

If you live in the States, then you should know better. We all know that the USPS is backed up and has been backed up since our whole “save the post office” and “help out small businesses”, due to COVID-19 and influx with online purchasing.

I could say that I’ve been purchasing from Etsy for those exact reasons. Yes, some packages arrive quicker than others, but that doesn’t say anything about the shop. It says that certain counties have less workers. Example, I live in a metropolitan area, and my friend’s dad works at the local post office. He says that we are receiving mail to be processed from the other side of the country, just to be processed here and sent back over there. Why? Because we need more workers. Why? More purchases, consumerism, quick delivery.

So what does this have to do with reviewing items on Etsy? Well, one should be reviewing the product and or shop. What was your interaction like? How was the product? Was it what you expected? We don’t purchase on Amazon, receive things beyond the promised 2 day shipping, then go back and give the Amazon app a 1 star or a, “if I could, I would give it zero stars because my package was late.” Like, c’mon people! It’s not the shop’s fault your package came late! Use your friggen noggin, figure out (constructively) the actual reasons you’re upset, and remember that your negative review hurts small businesses.

I am not a seller. I am a woman who reads reviews before buying, and I just got a little irritated having to sift through reviews that complain about something that has nothing to do with the shop or product, and all to do with postal services. Don’t get me wrong, I appreciate those negative reviews that talk about the product or customer service, because frankly, I’m not trying to support negative shop owners or spend money on poor product.

Also, while I’m here and in this rant.. **if you know it’s Christmas and most people shop on the app during or for holiday, look for presents throughout the year instead of last minute. Chances are, your package will arrive on time! Any super last minute purchases could be on Amazon or in person. That way, you don’t backfire trying to help small business with your negative review that it arrived late.

Update: thank you so much for the awards and upvotes! I truly hope that you and your businesses have much success this year.. and hopefully, more buyers will use their noggin and give more constructive reviews. I agree, taking the stars out would definitely help! Wish nothing but the best for you lot :)A friendly reminder on postal delivery and reviewing shops or products"

Would like to know how do you think of promotion. Does it boost sales? Or make you more willing to buy?

But on the other hand, I can set the price higher and then apply a promotion to make the price the same but looks different. What do you guys think? Thanks\~Does ""promotion"" really attract people?

Etsy,"I bought a pretty custom ring from a seller back in mid December. They had wonderful reviews, and pretty much everything looked similar to the pictures that were listed so I felt really confident. I reached out with some questions about customizing it and she told me that would be no issue at all (My husband passed away suddenly in a car accident, and I lost a lot of weight from the stress so my rings don't fit very well anymore. I wanted to continue wearing something meaningful, which I explained). We seemed to get everything sorted out, and I just waited.

A couple days ago I got my ring, and I was upset to discover it not only didn't look anything like it was supposed to, but it was also way bigger and doesn't fit me. It is my order for sure because it has the right customizations (my husband's initials), just nothing else, and I'm honestly not sure what happened? I don't want to ask for a refund because I'm sure she still did work hard on it, and I don't want to leave a bad review, but tbh I just feel super sad.

Etsy,"Hello.

I'm preparing to open my Etsy digital shop and I'm wondering about how to organize categories inside my shop. To describe everything clearly I will use an example of selling digital prints.

Let's say I will be selling different styles of prints with various colors. If I will have my own website I will make categories by style - for example: boho, marble, neon, animal prints, etc. I will make also categories by colors - for example: black &amp; white, gold, rose gold, blue, etc.

But I'm wondering what categories create in my Etsy shop. Should I make categories by styles &amp; colors? What if I'll want to sell something else and not only digital prints (but still similar items so creating another shop will be not the best idea).  

For me, shop like that will look better and will be easier to navigate for potential clients but I will need to make multiple listings for the same item (for example: gold leopard print will be in categories ""gold"" and ""animal prints""). When I'm checking other shops almost all of them have a mess in categories and look ugly. I don't know maybe people don't care about things like that but for me, it looks bad. If I will not make categories as I mentioned above then it will be hard to find something in my shop. But maybe no one is looking for items inside the shop but only from search?

Please give me any advice because my head almost explodes when I'm thinking about how to solve this problem.

Let's say I want to make a sticker (or set) that can fit in a letter. I'm pretty clueless and navigating the USPS website and other things is... intimidating. I'll have a list of questions so they're easier to answer! They're all in reference to US shipping, unless it mentions international.

1) Do you ship stickers in a letter, flat, or bubble mailer? Machinable or non machinable?

2) A lot of sticker makers mention putting cardstock in them to prevent the stickers from bending or getting folded. Wouldn't this make it non-machinable?

3) Do you offer tracking with your stickers? If so, how do you get it so cheap? I'd like to offer tracking for seller protection, but today I went to USPS and shipped a flat with tracking for $10! 

I hear a lot of etsy scammers target sticker shops with no tracking so they get more free stickers. I'm interested in hearing about ya'lls opinion.

4) For those who print labels at home, how exactly is it done? I know this sounds really dumb, but do you just print it out on regular paper and tape it to the envelope? Do you print it on sticker/label paper? From just a normal printer?

Etsy,"Hi! So I purchased 3 scrunchies from a seller in Toronto, Canada (I am in United States, California) on January 6, 2021 and they shipped them January 13, 2021. They did not provide tracking information. 














On January 28, I asked the seller for tracking information (I told her the package wasn't late, but if she had it I like tracking the package.) and she said she didn't buy tracking and put it in a mailbox. 














February 10 (original estimate was February 3) I tell her I still haven't received them, she told me that she will check with the post office. She never got back to me. I checked in February 19, and February 24 with no reply. 















I know that the postal office is crazy, but I have received packages from Japan, South Korea, China, England, and Australia within this time period (wedding stuff - don't judge me!) and they all had tracking. 














What should I do? Is it okay to open a case without being bratty about it?

Etsy,"I know USPS is still dealing with significant delays in many areas, but I've noticed a trend in the packages I've sent that are being excessively delayed or lost in transit, and I'm wondering if anyone else is experiencing something similar or has any insights.

When I ship stickers I use the ""Flat"" package type for my rigid cardboard mailers.  For a 6x8 mailer this only costs $1.40 and provides a tracking number that starts with ""003"" rather than the typical ""9"".  

During the peak of holiday delays, I was informed by multiple postmaster generals that this ""003"" tracking number was not a ""real"" tracking number that could be looked up by USPS. After doing some poking around in the Esty subreddits I learned that the tracking provided for flat mailers is not specific to the individual package, but is provided based on the scan of the bin housing the package (which is why you can't track down the individual piece of mail should there be a problem).

I only experienced a handful of issues during the holiday rush, with most flat mailers being successfully delivered, so I continued to use that setting knowing it came with a little risk.  Conversely, I've not had nearly as many issues with padded envelopes - a few were dramatically delayed around the holidays, but all ended up arriving eventually (which is particularly great because handmade art is a lot harder to replace than stickers). 

Now, in the last two months, almost every flat mailer I send out is getting stuck marked ""in transit"" indefinitely.  I've even had a couple be delivered, but their tracking still just shows ""in transit"" (the only reason I know they arrived is because I received a review of the item!)

So based on this experience, I guess I'll be switching back to padded mailers and charging $3+ for sticker shipping (which seems crazy!), because at this point I'm losing money on sending out so many replacements.

**Has anyone else had any similar issues with flat mailers, or have any advice for something I might be doing wrong?**

Etsy,"I was doing some market research, and came across a shop that sells digital patterns.

Curious, I looked at the shop. All of the patterns appear to be scanned from other people's work, i.e., from books, old stand-alone patterns, etc. None of them are original. (That I saw)

Now, my understanding of the First Sale Doctrine is that it is ok to sell an item that is copyright, as long as you do not retain a copy. For example, if you sell a CD, it is illegal to also retain a copy of the music, because that is copyright infringement. As seller is reselling these, multiple times, they are violating the First Sale Doctrine.

The seller puts no identifying information on the patterns, so it is impossible to identify the source, but they photos and text specifically show that these are not original, but taken from the work of others. 

Now I know things do go into the public domain eventually, but these items are from the 1960's, 70's, 80's, etc.

Etsy,"Hi everyone, I'm a new Etsy seller and i only opened my store last month, but I'm encountering an issue where I think a buyer is trying to scam me for a refund or a free product. About 10 days ago I sent her an order, I sell ceramics so she bought a big bowl and a small bowl. I had never sold two pieces together, so I had to package it differently than I normally do (important later). She messaged me this morning saying she only received one of the items, the smaller bowl. I was very confused at first, because I did send her both, I make to order so it's not like I have a spare large bowl sitting around, and it's not like I have enough orders where I could confuse them, this was on the only one I had to send this week. Just to make sure nothing happened, I asked her to send me a photo of the packaging, just to make sure I didn't accidentally send her the wrong one, and the photos she sent me were of the special packaging I had to buy specifically for her order, to fit both the large bowl and the small bowl. The packaging is too big for me to have used it just to send the small bowl.

I’m a little clueless as to how taxes work and I don’t want to make an error TT any help will be great! Thanks for reading my post!Legal advice?"
Etsy,"I had a message today from a customer who bought a $60 item on Sunday Feb. 21. I shipped it via USPS first class on Monday the 22nd. It was scanned once the next day when it left the local distribution center and then nothing since. The estimated delivery date was Thursday the 25th, but it has now been updated to say ""your package is in transit, arriving late."" 
 
 I understand that the customer is disappointed, but the package is literally 2 business-days late. If this person is already so impatient, I feel like they're just a budding problem. 
 
How do I reply and what should I do here? I don't mind sending another if it's lost or damaged, but what's a reasonable time to wait?

Etsy,"I finally reached 1,000 sales a couple weeks ago!
Here’s my [shop.](https://www.etsy.com/shop/societalstickers/) 

I started my shop in June, and I didn’t think it would go anywhere. I can’t draw, can’t do digital art, can’t take photos, can barely use Photoshop. It’s honestly shocking that the shop has made it so far, so I thought I’d write down some thoughts and reflections for other non-skilled sticker sellers:

1. Establish a unique (?) style that sets you apart from other sticker sellers. I think that the Etsy sticker market is definitely over-saturated, especially with cutesy, planner-type, stickers. My shop only started picking up steam when I switched to vintage pulp magazine-type stickers. Donating all of my proceeds is also something that set it apart.

2. Start with low quality. This might seem counterintuitive, but I started with stickers that were mostly not waterproof, not glossy, cut poorly, cheap packaging. I make all of the stickers in-house, and I couldn’t afford to laminate or buy a Silhouette. It was only after some time that I understood there was real potential in my shop, and started buying better supplies and packaging.

3. Take good photos. Photos don’t need to be artsy or beautiful. They need to show off the product, with accurate colors. My photos aren’t the best. They aren’t pretty or uniform (with the same background). But I do try to edit them to be vibrant and crisp. I make sure that the sticker stands out against the background. I usually use moleskine notebooks as the background w direct, golden hour, lighting.

4. Social media is overrated. I think for some products they might work, especially products that look like they would belong on Pinterest, but my shop doesn’t have any social media. I’ve never bought ads. Maybe one of these days I’ll set up an Instagram, but I’ve never really felt the point (esp w my crappy photography skills).

5. Don’t stress out too much about more superficial aspects, like packaging or fixing that 4-star review. I have a ton of 4-star reviews from people with didn’t read the description, or thought the sticker would be larger. None of those things are my fault, and some people are destined to find fault in everything. My average is still 5 stars, so who cares? Also having crappy packaging is better for the environment. For a while, I was just using old magazines to wrap stickers.

6. Add new products frequently. Every week, I try to add another sticker. I also remove listings that aren’t doing well, and have only sold twice. Why? Because it’s hard to keep so many different types of stickers constantly in stock.

7. For shipping: try to do free shipping. I know it’s hard, but all of my listings have free shipping. I also ship w/o tracking using stamps. In practice, it means that a lot of stickers don’t arrive, but I’ve found that shipping out a new sticker is much cheaper than shipping w/o tracking or having to pay for gas to drive to the post office to drop off a package.

8. For the more technical aspect: don’t underestimate SEO. Use a diverse set of tags (decals, vinyl, waterproof, etc). Use multiple words in tags, and use all of your tags. Also, for product descriptions, make sure they’re clear and make sense to the reader. Minimal grammatical mistakes. Use many photos (I’m not perfect on this).


Anyways, that’s all I have for now. Good luck everyone!1,000 sales! + reflections on stickers"
Etsy,"I’m thinking of opening a store that’ll sell some art supplies like glitters, dried flowers and paintbrushes. I tried to google and checked the policy on Etsy. It seems it’s allowed but it’s not entirely clear if supplies have to be handmade too.

Etsy,"A couple of weeks ago you may have seen my post 'My shop has disappeared!'. Turned out it had been hacked. Loads of transactions, buying and selling, had been put through. All were stopped by both Etsy and my bank, but it caused me a lot of time and hassle and probably some sales. My shop was closed for about a week, I had to get a new bank card, change my password for my shop, enter new card details and then found out this horrible person had also amended the price and quantity and shipping details of every item in my shop.

So, got a new card, updated my shop, Etsy put me back on line and it has happened again within a few days. What is going on? Is it happening to anyone else?

This time I was lucky enough to pick it up very quickly, contact Etsy and my bank. Now have to wait about 5 days for a new card and do it all over again.

Etsy,"I got a one star recently on an instant download because the buyer claimed they ""Could not find the file anywhere! Not in my purchases , not in my email from Etsy! "".

Etsy,"For context: I got my first 1 star review after nearly 1400 sales and am a bit irked by the grounds of it. The customer incorrectly stated that the item doesn’t include features it in fact does (and is stated as so in item description), they are (to me) very blatantly experiencing user error and after immediately reaching out to help solve their issue, they weren’t at all receptive in a resolution. 
Here’s what I really want to respond with to their review: 

Hi *buyer*,

Fortunately, this sounds like a user error and will be an easy fix! As stated in the item description, this item comes with 2 files. One includes a perforated line to act as the scoring line and the other is a blank card that you can add your own scoring line into. I sent you a message and would love to walk you through your difficulties! Please feel free to reply and we can easily get this figured out. 

Thank you!

Etsy,"Hi! I just recently decided to start selling prints of my photographs on Etsy and I was planning to print them myself to start, but the biggest I can print at home is 8x10. I see that most people selling photo prints, as far as I can tell, don't have anything smaller than that and always have lots of larger options also.

I understand they have a printing company print for them, that's how they're usually able to do that, and they just drop ship things to customers. I've been having a very hard time finding a good, Canadian company that I could go to. I've tried Canvas Champ in the past, but was unsatisfied with the results as well as their customer service (plus they don't even print in Canada, they have everything printed in India).

I would mostly like to support a Canadian business for this so if anyone has any good suggestions I'd be SO grateful. And if anyone that prints from home has any tips that would be great, too!Want to sell photography prints, unsure who to go to for printing services."
Etsy,"Posting this for my husband, since he doesn't have Reddit.

He sent a package from the US to Canada that shipped November 20th.

Tracking says on November 20th Departed USPS Regional Facility. November 24th In Transit To Next Facility. And that's where it ends. Normally, the next line for Canada will be customs clearance, but that isn't there.

The customer contacted him towards the end of January, stating that she hasn't received it yet. He didn't know if it was the holiday rush or an issue with customs, so he asked her to contact her local post master, because he figured the package was in Canada by that time. She didn't respond or follow up again.

Today (March 1st), she contacted him and says the Canada website says ""The product associated with this tracking number does not qualify for this type of service ticket. Please go back to the previous page and double-check the eligibility requirements.""

He asked her what the post office told her. She didn't respond, but she opened a case against his shop.

Could this be a case of the buyer not paying customs fees? Any thoughts on the best way to respond to the case?

Any advice would be welcome. Thanks!Case opened on order from Canada"

Etsy,"So I sell cute little rope belts and I ship them out in a compostable mailer. It's pretty lightweight - 2 oz. and unnecessary to use a large box. I discovered this morning that an order I shipped out a while back had been adjusted from my normal $3-something to over $10. They adjusted my 2 oz. package/thick envelope to a 2 oz. USPS Flat Rate Medium Box. I don't even stock those boxes! The dimensions of my small parcel is the same for the ""USPS Flat Rate Medium Box"" which would actually be impossible. I reached out to them today via email, but I don't know what the likelihood is of getting this reversed. Has anyone been successful at contesting it? 

I use Pirate Ship once in a while and heard that they would contest this on my behalf if I had gone through them. Anyone know if that's the case?

Etsy,"I ordered two little head vases that are girls with cat ears or bunny ears (like they're wearing a headband) and they're blowing a pink bubble.  I wanted one with each type headbands and ended up with two with cat ears. The seller is supposedly from PA but it was drop shipped. When I contacted the seller about the fact that I got the wrong vase they replied back that the vase was hand made and that they couldn't control the quality of the product.  That's straight up bull since they have advertisements with each style and it's not a custom or hand made piece.

Here's my issue,  do I pursue it further with the seller? Or go to customer support? I had already replied and told them it wasn't a custom order and I want what I paid for but it took them a day to respond and they only have 5 sales to their store, two of them from me.A seller is claiming that my item is a custom order and they can't refund me my money or do an exchange."

Etsy,"A few months ago, I started a custom order for someone. They paid a materials deposit then, and paid the rest a few weeks ago before I shipped the order.

So I asked if they would call the bank, and now I’m waiting to hear back.

I haven’t heard anything from Etsy yet, but I’m kind of freaking out. How does the process of a dispute work on Etsy? Since nothing shipped for the deposit, I don’t know how to prove anything.

Etsy,"Totally just a rant, but I had to get it out somewhere.   


I had someone post a 4 star review for me today, that was kinda snarky and implied that the plant may not live, but they must have posted a five star initially unless I missed where you can post a pic now with a less than 5-star review. I wish I could get the picture removed. 

The picture is of the plant that they bought from me...I guess. But the plant doesn't look like anything I have ever sent out. She received it two weeks ago. The leaves look thin and dry and dull and she has it repotted in the completely wrong medium and in a mason jar with no drainage. It's a plant that should be kept constantly moist and in orchid moss. And I have 2500 of them, so I would have no reason to send anything that looked like what she has. But I am guessing she is just killing it with it being in the wrong container and medium. 

Since she didn't message me to say that she was having any problems, I sent her a long message explaining that it will die if she doesn't repot it back into the same kind of media I sent it in, and pointed out specific things that were wrong with it now that being in the wrong media was causing, gave her suggestions on where to get the right stuff, and told her I would be happy to walk her thru repotting this very specific, specialty type of plant that I have been professionally growing for years.

She responded and told me that she saw someone else do it on Youtube the way she did and they said that was better for the plant, so despite the fact that she is knocking \*my\* stars off, post pictures of it in medium I don't want anyone else to try to use, and the plant no longer even looks like anything I sell in just two short weeks, she can't take my advice as a grower over that of a YouTuber.

Guaranteed, when it dies in two weeks she will change her review and say it came that way.Just another rant about plants."

I feel so grateful and my heart is so full that people want to stick my stickies on their beloved things. I'm still new to selling but here are some things  I did that I think really helped my shop:

* Taking great product photos, I think natural sunlight is the best way to show off your product! I also created a custom filter preset on the Lightroom app so all my listings share a similar color theme/style which helps give your Etsy a more 'cohesive' look in my opinion :D
* Adding personal details to your packaging, I handmade all my packaging supplies and write a handwritten note with every order so the buyer knows how much I appreciate them for shopping at DibDabDoo!
* Posting on TikTok and other social media platforms. I know it can be hard to post consistently so I recommend creating content in large batches. Instead of just making 1 tik tok or 1 instagram post, try to create 3-4 pieces of content all at once so you have content to post throughout the week

I hope these tips help others and hope everyone has an amazing day because I feel on top of the world right now!! ❤️I just hit 100 sales! 🥳❤️"
Etsy,"Tl;dr: Custom Valentine's day gift showed up 2 weeks late and very incorrect. Opened a case and the Seller offered me a new item, but I just want to send it back for a refund and be done with it and them. What do I do?

Ordered a custom knife based off an existing listing. The listing was for a plain wood handled folding knife **without a pocket clip**. I asked for some details to be changed (brass to copper, different type of wood for the handle), that the knife be **specifically oriented for a left-handed person** to use, and I needed it **before Valentine's day**. Seller assured me all of these customizations could be done within the timeframe, so I finalized the order on 1/28.

2/5 (estimated delivery date) came and went so I messaged the seller to check. I figured a custom order would take a little longer and the seller confirmed my thinking, said it would be shipped ""next week"". Not a problem at all.

2/12 still haven't heard anything and figure it's the last day to get it in the mail so that is have it by V-day, so I message again. Seller hits me back and says they thought they had all the parts for the customizations when I paid, but they actually didn't and the guy they ordered the part from is running behind. They told me again that the item would ship ""next week"", which fucking sucked. I didn't have time to figure out an alternate gift and if I had known they couldn't do it within my timeframe I would have ordered from another shop or figured something else out. Pissed but whatever, shit happens. Around this time the seller gets really difficult to get in contact with.

I reach out once or twice with questions about the product and shipping to no response. On 2/18 I check again and see they marked it ""shipped"" the day before (2/17) with no tracking number or info. Figure it won't be long now.

Check again on 2/24, no tracking updates since 2/22, so I check back everyday after that for updates meanwhile also contacting the seller for info on shipping insurance (he didn't pay for any, $150 item insured by usps for $50), no response from seller.

**2/27 it finally arrives**, with a label that was purchased on 2/19 (so their self-reported ship date was a straight up lie). The brass details are copper, which is correct to what I ordered. However while the thumb stud (opening mechanism) of the knife is oriented for a lefty, **the liner lock (closing mechanism) is oriented for a right-handed person still.** Additionally there is a **pocket clip attached with two screws into the wooden handle**, when the original listing did not mention a pocket clip in the pictures nor the item description and I never approved the addition.

Same day I opened a case since it was profoundly late *and* incorrect, refund as the ideal resolution. Seller argued that people love pocket clips and that I could detach it myself if I didn't want it. I pointed out all the other issues with the order and that detaching the clip would leave two unfinished screw holes in the wood handle leaving it more suceptible to chipping and minor water damage.

Seller is now telling me to keep the knife and they'll send me a new one when I'd rather just have the refund. It's a custom order, so I understand that a refund is not typical, but it's literally an item that is not what I ordered and arrived two full-ass weeks after I needed it. I'm perfectly happy to send it back, and after as bad as they fucked this up I just DON'T want to work with them again. I don't want another knife, I just want my money back.

How do I proceed? Do I have any recourse since they ARE technically offering me a solution, or can I refuse their offer? And lastly, do I even have a chance at a refund on this custom order?I had to open a case with a shop and I requested a refund. Now the seller is saying they'll just send me a new item when I'd really prefer the refund. What do I do?"
Etsy,"So I found a seller that does customized items that I really would like. They have at least 5-7 different sample photos of their work and it's all lovely, but they don't have a single review nor any sells. This person is charging around $60 for their handcrafted products, while other sellers typically charge around $80-$150 for similar handmade items. 

I'd love to support this person, and I'd even leave a review for them once I got my product, but a part of me is a little wary of if this is a scam. I've tried looking up other platforms on social media they might use and all I found was an inactive Instagram that was made roughly 4 years ago that has no content on it.

So I'm unsure if I should trust this seller and go for it or back out. Thoughts or suggestions?

Also, if I did go with it and never got my product, is there any guarentee Etsy could help me out in getting a refund?Trustworthy or not?"

Etsy,"Hi guys

I recently tried to purchase an item through Etsy from a seller with 0 ratings, no store policies written and no description of the store is available on Etsy as well. Additionally, the item that they are selling is sold out everywhere, but is somehow listed as in stock still after being active the whole day after a number of people had purchased it.

After doing a bit of reverse google image searching, I found the picture of the seller to be for another more Established Etsy account. I reported the store, and not to my surprise, the other item they were selling could be found in a reverse google image search to another page.

I've paid for the item through Paypal, and cancelled the payment as the payment was not received. 

I might be a bit paranoid, but I think the scammer would have our address. I don't feel comfortable about that at all lol. am I unreasonable to think so? 

How does the process work going forward? Does paypal reach out to the seller to let them know I cancelled the pending payment?Etsy - bought from scammer, cancelled payment to seller."
Etsy,"Hi, my buyer accidentally bought the same item twice, so I'm cancelling the 2nd order and refunding them. This is the first time I've ever had a cancellation, so I want to understand if I am reading this correctly.

The item was $19 with $2 shipping, for $21 total. I understand the fee credits that Etsy is giving back to me [see photos here](https://imgur.com/a/3iC6157) because I currently have $18.87 in my payment account and fees taken out were for the payment processing fee ($0.88), the transaction fee ($0.95), and the shipping fee ($0.10). I guess they won't refund the 0.20 autorenewal listing fee since I had multiples, but that's fine. 

The part where I am confused is in the second photo in the link I shared where it says $1.25 will be charged to my Discover to cover the remainder of the refund. I believe that number comes from the transaction fee ($0.95) and the shipping fee ($0.10) plus the listing fee of $0.20 that it charged for the autorenewal. I assume that Etsy will credit me that $0.95 + $0.10 and I'll just have to pay the $0.20 for the listing? It seems like such a weird way to go about it, but I'm reading this correctly, right? Thanks


UPDATE: I went ahead and submitted the cancellation and Etsy did refund my 0.20 listing, so that's nice. I still have a payment account balance of $1.05 now that I owe, so I hope I get those credits.First time canceling &amp; refunding an order, not sure if I am being charged for the cancellation"

Etsy,"Hey friends,

Hoping for some help / insight if anybody else has had success with this.

The TL;DR is that I want to create my own self-branded shop that can sync with Etsy. The reason is I have one item that sells well on Etsy and brings its own traffic. The other items have sold through self-generated traffic. 

I started with square because I had already integrated that with Etsy. I bought a reader in hopes of attending and selling my crafts at local festivals and shows, and not have to worry about overselling inventory (but, you know. Covid). 

I had hoped to just keep using Square on my self-hosted website with Wordpress / Woocommerse but so far that has been a nightmare, and from what I've read It's probably not worth pursuing. 

I was thinking about maybe switching over to Shopify as it looks like there are some plug-ins that allow this to work, but that appears to be more expensive. I'm not selling enough right now to balance out how much that would cost to pay for Shopify as well as the subscription for that plugin. 

So I was wondering if anybody else has had any luck here? I don't mind paying for platforms / plugins but I don't want to invest a ton of money that I'm not making back on solutions that aren't going to work. 

Any suggestions would be amazing. I hope this wasn't too wordy!

Thank you!Has anybody had any luck syncing inventory between Etsy &amp; Wordpress / Woocomerse?"

Did anyone actually tried to use this thing? I find it interesting just not sure if it's worth the time and effort. I would highly appreciate any and all experience you guys can share.

Etsy,"I purchased a ring (not cheap) from an Etsy seller back in early January. She makes it known up front that it will take a month to create and then ship it to me (international shipment from Swiss Post to USPS).

I received a confusing email last week from Etsy saying that the order had been delivered. It had not been. As far as I knew, it had not even been shipped yet.

I messaged the seller to ask her why the item was listed as delivered. She gave me a tracking number that she said she would be using for my shipment. She also gave me some proof that she did indeed mail something to the US. Okay, so I checked out the tracking number she gave me for USPS. It was used to successfully deliver something to a completely different city and state in the US back in November of 2020. So the status of that tracking number is Delivered. It's of no use to me.

I asked her why she was using this old tracking number. She said the numbers are issued by the Swiss Post.  I emailed USPS to ask if my item would be successfully delivered even with a recycled tracking number. They told me to go ask the Etsy seller for a new tracking number. So, I contacted the seller with that question. Suddenly, she announces her shop will be shut down for at least a month because she needs to 'catch up on things'. Am I screwed here? The only thing I have is this info from the Swiss Post:

Thursday, 18 February 2021

**22:52**  
**Forwarding abroad**  
**8010 Zürich Briefzentrum International**

If the item shows up someday, that would be great. It's just that the a) useless recycled tracking number and b) the seller's lack of communication are throwing up some major red flags.

Etsy,"So to make it as short as possible, my husband bought a ring from an Etsy store. They had given a time frame that states within 2-3 weeks the ring will be made and the estimated time of delivery which was Feb 6th-19th. Then the store owner messaged him on Feb 19th pretty much saying that they have to mark the order as “shipped” (even though it wasn’t shipped yet) just so Etsy wouldn’t “punish” them. Then they proceeded to send the order finally on Feb 26th. 

My question is, could we go through Etsy to ask for help with this? My husband ordered ahead of time January 19th in order for me to get the ring while I was visiting him in time for our wedding. I read on Etsy.com that you needed consent from the buyer saying “yes you can extend the timeframe” which they did not. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

Etsy,"Just received my first one star from none other than a buyer I got through off-site ads.

Now I don't mean this will be all off-site ad buyers but this it was worth noting as I've seen that you get slightly different buyers through it.

As soon as she purchased I was instantly bombarded with messages asking when the item would be done etc. It's a while before I reply, I'm in the UK and the buyer is US, so there was a time difference. But I politely reply when I can explaining I'd have the item finished by the end of the week (in line with my displayed turnaround) and shortly receive an ""ok thnx"", fine no problems yet.

Over the next few days I receive multiple messages asking specifics about the item (after having purchased), if it is finished yet and what day it will arrive on. I answer them all over the days and try my best to answer the last one considering I'm not the postal service.

I admittedly decide to get the item done a little quicker so I will stop receiving messages and ship the item out. Now in the UK I use royal mail standard international, which doesn't give tracking. I do this as tracking is an extra £2 and I thought it best to keep costs down for international buyers plus I've never had a problem and they generally arrive in reasonable time (keep in mind my items are only £6-20 and she'd purchased one £6 item).
After 3 days I get a message asking where the item is and to provide her with tracking. I explain that there isn't tracking but provide her with the confirmation number and a screenshot to prove it's been sent, and again recieving an ""ok thnx"".

Another 3 days pass and I get a message claiming the tracking number doesnt work, she hasn't received the item and if I can check where the item is. Obviously I cannot check where it is and I explain again that it wasn't a tracking number as I'd made clear before. ""Ok thnx"".
Fast forward to today (a week later) and I've seen I've got my first 1 star review claiming she never received the item and I'd given her a fake tracking number, but she ""wishes she could rate me higher"" -_-

Now not the worst experience out there but I'll be honest it just sucks, especially to have that amongst my other quite glowing reviews. Even more considering after all her messaging she just didn't message when it actually mattered and jumped to a negative review :(

I guess it's partially my fault for not sending on the more expensive tracked option to all international buyers but I don't think they'd pay the extra cost on a £6 item.

Etsy,"Hi, new seller here. My shop is small and doesn't get much traffic, so right now I'm keeping it simple by only shipping to the US (where I live). I want to avoid issues with additional customs fees and longer shipping times, until I'm a bit more experienced.

My question for the US based sellers here who ship internationally:

1. What percentage of your orders are shipped outside of the US? 
2. What country/region outside of the US do you ship most to?
3. Generally speaking, what category of items do you sell?
4.  How do the non-US customer reviews compare to the US customer reviews? 

* Less satisfied, About the same, or More satisfied?

I’m not at all expecting Etsy to remove it, but figured why not try anyway before responding. I didn’t get any confirmation of reporting the review so just wondering if/how I’ll get word on Etsy’s decision to keep or remove the review.

Recently, I noticed that the colors on the magnets (all three!) are completely faded and the edges of the design are lifting off the actual magnet. If it was just one magnet, I would assume it was a fluke, but the fact that it happened to all of them is frustrating and annoying. I left a review stating this and the seller messaged me, clearly upset, stating that they believe their products are up to standard and they’ve never had any problems like this. I have a hard time believing that because, again, it happened to all three magnets I ordered. I messaged back expressing my disappointment and they then told me that the magnets are made using “external materials and machines” and that they are “not fully in control of the process and anything could go wrong”

Etsy,"I've been an Etsy seller (amongst other things) for over ten years now and I can unequivocally say that the most annoying part of it is the people! (Only the 20% of people that cause most of the trouble, of course.)

So, I've developed strategies to deal with the headache caused by the 20%; whether it's from being too needy, rude, impossible to please, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

Strategy #1 - Who Cares?!

Yes, it's your shop, your baby and you put pride into your work... but if someone doesn't see it the same way you do, or has given you a bad review. F\*\*\* 'em!

Strategy #2 - Responses

It's hard for many people to come across as polite or non-needy in writing, so it's best to respond to everyone in the most polite manner that you can muster. Oftentimes, someone whom you thought was impolite/needy/demanding in their first message will turn out not to be that way after your reply.

Make sure that you greet your customers by name, acknowledge their reason for enquiry, reassure them, explain something to them, thank them (my favourite is to thank them in advance for their ""patience and understanding"") and wish them a great day/week/weekend in closing! Don't expect a reply back, either, but know that they read your message.

Lots of customers simply want to know that the seller is around, so even a short reply is better than no reply....

... which brings us back to the 20%. If they really are being unreasonable, there is no reason to reply to their constant or threatening/rude messages right away... give it a day, or two, or three...

Strategy #3 - Let Them Eat Case

Yes, case not cake! If you unfortunately encounter the 20% of the 20%, they'll open a case on your a\*\* and you might be concerned or worried. Don't be! The worst that can happen is that you have to provide a full refund (and you've already sent out your item, so you lose that, too).

If someone opens a case against you, you can still be polite, but there is now absolutely no reason to try to please them. If this person was going to be able to work something out with you, they wouldn't have opened a case.

If someone leaves you a bad review without even contacting you about a resolution, well, they've basically said that they accept whatever and are closed to negotiations. You should be closed, as well. Respond politely to their negative review and never think about it again.

Thinking back, when purchasing the label, it states that each label comes with $100 of insurance. I thought that meant the items were automatically insured for up to $100.

Etsy,"I sell and buy on Etsy, but this is the first time I've seen this and I wondered if it's a new trend. I bought a few items from two different Etsy shops. The first shop sent me a message asking me how I liked my item the day after it was shipped. It hasn't even been delivered yet. 

The second shop emailed me on the expected delivery date to ask how I liked the items, too. Again, the items hadn't even been delivered. I understand how important it is to receive reviews, but it was irritating to receive these messages. Etsy already badgers buyers to leave reviews, and getting messages asking for feedback before I've even received the items feels spammy and desperate to me. I never email buyers to ask for feedback.

But maybe I'm in the minority. Has anyone tried this strategy? What has been your experience asking for feedback in this way?Sellers asking for reviews/feedback"
Etsy,"Hey guys!

So here's the deal. We make custom made items - individuals order our item, send in what they want made and we design and produce it, in short.

The listing had examples from my customers in the form of collages as the listing photos.

The 7th picture showed a design I made of a popular anime character  that was requested in an order a while back. The anime character design was not mentioned in the listing, was not in the tags and I am not interested in selling it as a product itself, I just was showing some of my work.

This picture resulted in a copyright infringement notice and the listing being taken down.

Okay, yes, I understand the grounds of the notice. I can remove the photo since I am not selling that product, it was just an example of my work.

My question is this - **is the listing like, blacklisted or something now?** Do i have to ask the copyright holder to accept revisions or do I just enable it to be visible again and move on?

The listing has absolutely nothing that could be copyright struck now but Im concerned that relisting it without permission would get me in trouble.

I reached out to etsy and they sent back a copy and pasted email that said that they cant get involved in copyright matters. 

This custom design listing is by far my most popular item, its flagged as the best seller in its category and has about $25-30K in sales. 

 Its purely for custom designs provided from the buyer.

Have you guys ever re-enabled a listing after it got a copyright strike?Relisting a copyright struck item without flagged content?"
Etsy,"I sell customized digital download images, and I'm getting ready to go into my busy season. Up until this point, I have sent customers a proof image on Etsy messages, then emailed them the hi-res file after they approve the proof. This is fine when I'm getting only 5-10 orders per day. During my busy season, however, I get upwards of 20-30 orders per day, and it really eats into my time to have to go through and email each customer after they approve their proof. 

I'm wondering if there is a file management solution out there that I can send customers a link to their file and they can download from there, rather than from an email. Basically what I'm looking for is something where I can upload the image, the buyer can approve it or ask for changes, I can make those changes (if needed), and they can download the hi-res from the same link. Ideally this would be something connected to my file management system to eliminate any extra upload steps.

Etsy,"I recently saw an Etsy shop with a listing titled ""Tip the Creator"" for $1, so that buyers could add that to their order, or as many of them as they wanted, to tip the shop owner. I just wondered how people feel about this? Is it allowed? Does it go against Etsy's policies?

Just curious really, I've been selling on Etsy for about a year now and have over 1600 sales, and the thought of getting a tip on some of those would have been amazing haha! But a part of me also feels weird about it... hmm....

Etsy,"As an Etsy shop owner, I made a lot of rookie mistakes when I first started and boy do I wish someone told me. So here's a list of things you should do to make sure your shop is set up for success!

1. Take good pictures: I literally cannot stress this enough! This is the only way your customers get to see the product before paying for it, they don't get to hold it in their hand or anything so it has to be well represented. Get good lighting, a cute background (you should even show it in use so your customers get a feel for how it would look when they put it on their items) and a good camera (your phone camera, depending on the quality of course, can be good if you're just starting out.)
2. Fill out the description: With EVERYTHING! Explain the product to your customers as if they can't even see pictures of it. Use this space to share a little background (keep it short and simple), material, size, and anything you can that would cross your customers mind. If you receive a lot of questions asking the same thing, be sure to add it to the description.

\*TIP: If you used any props for your photos, be sure to let them know that props are not included in the purchase. It is for demonstration only and is the sale for only the item. You'd be surprised how many people think the props are included.

Also, be sure to mention that colors may vary from screen to screen. Blue on your screen might not look the same on your screen which might not look the exact same in real life. You try to show true representation in your pictures, but cannot control other people's screens.

3. Use all tags: You got 13 of them. USE THEM ALL. Every tag is an opportunity to show up in a         search so not using all of them can miss out on a lot of potential sales. Long-tail keywords are preferred here for best results.

4. Your shop appearance: Your logo, your about, your announcements, your policies, your featured listings, everything should be filled out. It'll show your customers that you're serious about your shop and give off a great first impression. Plus, people buy with emotions. They want to know why or how you created something, it's human nature.

Hope these helped! Do you have any advice you'd like to share? Share with us below!Want your shop to be successful? Read this!"

From my ""Finances - Payment Account - All Last Year"" page, I see a list at the bottom of ""Sales and Credits"" and ""Taxes and Fees"". When I subtract the taxes and fees, I get a number.

Next I go to ""Stats - Last Year"", and get a different income/sales number.

Then I check the ""Legal &amp; Tax Info"" page and get another number, that obviously doesn't have any fees deducted from it. When I try to subtract the fees listed on the previous page, the final amount is still different from the previous two pages.

Lastly, I go to ""Dashboard - Stats Overview for All Channels - Last Year"", and get another number. This one is even different from the number on the actual ""Stats"" page.

All of these numbers are different, and I am unable to subtract fees, etc... to get any two to be the same. I can't find where to download my csv file anywhere.

Etsy,"Hi community,

Does anyone in the EU have any experience with shipping to the UK since post Brexit? Mostly in regards to possibly having to obtain an EORI number? I'm experiencing delays with parcels being sent sent there - when following the tracking with UPS, the parcels only make it to a holding depot here in Germany and there is a message - 'there is a delay, due to Brexit-related problems.'

Nowhere in Etsy or Packlink i.e. filling out the customs form, does anybody mention or ask for such a number. However, when recently emailing with a supplier of mine based in the UK, they said everybody sending in and out of the UK has to have an EORI number..

Looking forward to hearing your replies!

Etsy,"I have a fairly large Etsy shop with over 43,000 sales but I am just now encountering a problem that I literally have no idea how to handle. I have had a few customers contact me over the past few days regarding their packages being significantly delayed. When I tracked both of them, it appears they made it from my local USPS to the Distribution Center and then NOTHING.  No updates at all after that. These were both shipped out on February 15th, with the last scan being February 16th. I informed the customers that I was looking into it and if there hasn’t been tracking updated by Monday evening, I will issue a replacement order. 

BUT THEN..... I looked into all of my orders that shipped that same day (approximately 120 orders), and I found that 24 of my orders from that shipment all have the same problem. They were all shipped to two different Distribution Centers and then no updates since February 16th. This prompted me to print out all of my shipping receipts and March directly into my local USPS (and bring out my inner ‘Karen’).  The USPS agent was actually very nice but had no idea as to why so many were being held up. Then I looked at my orders that were shipped out on February 18th, and over 50 of those orders are also held up. I also then looked at my orders that shipped out on Feb 22nd and the same thing.... many orders being completely held up with no updates in the tracking. 

I just don’t understand why. There are many First Class Mail packages and many Priority Mail packages.  Also, these include flat rate envelopes as well as boxes. I have been in business for 3 years and have never changed my shipping process. I know my labels and postage are correct. 

I explained to my USPS agent that this is thousands of dollars worth of product and postage, and if I get a bad review for all of these orders, it will literally put me completely out of business. To say that I am completely besides myself and pulling out my hair is an understatement. I have absolutely no idea what to do now or what to tell my customers who have been waiting 2 weeks for their orders, at no fault of mine or their own.

Etsy,"Hi! So I run a relatively established shop, doing maybe 15-20 orders a day. For the first two years I was crazy excited everytime I got an order, and while it still occasionally blows my mind, I often feel anxious about not being able to be there for all my customers (over the course of a week, I end up having to please and keep track of at least hundred new faces).The packing process has slowly become a dread because of this anxiety (it also does become repetitive once you've done it over three thousand times).

I don't want to sound ungrateful (there's truly nothing I'm more passionate about/care about) and I recognize that in order to continue to create, I need to accept that there are points with relatively menial tasks, but the performance anxiety is really building and making this tough.

The estimated delivery date was the 12th, but it's been in pre-transit since the 10th. I reached out to the seller twice on Etsy and twice on Instagram over the past week but have heard nothing. Her Etsy shop is currently closed, so I got the bounce back message, but she's been somewhat active on Instagram stories, and I DMed her twice. 

Recently she posted that she had some trouble with USPS holding orders and not shipping them so I reached out to inquire if mine was one, but again, have heard nothing.

I feel like what's *technically* legal and what will get you a copyright strike on Etsy may differ. I may not be breaking any laws (or maybe I am), but do I have millions of dollars to fight off Warner Bros if they decide to be heavy-handed? Nope.

And on top of that I don’t have specific packaging, I just reuse boxes &amp; mailers so every item I would sell, would likely to be in a different package, which is why I just have to guess/can’t accurately assume a size.

I’m just confused because the weight will change when packaged, and they don’t say the “(when packed)” for the weight part, only for the size/dimensions do they say that.

Is it really that big of a deal?

Is the shipping prices that different if you get the dimensions/weight a bit off? 

Could a package be delivered back to me if the weight doesn’t match what it really weighs? (Like if I put a 12 oz item sold as a 4oz item)

Thanks in advance! (New to Etsy, moving over from Poshmark)Confused as to how to calculate items size &amp; weight of items.. they say calculate it as packaged, but what if you don’t know how you’ll package it?"
Etsy,"Hi everyone,

I've recently been receiving some really positive feedback on some art I've been doing and thought about opening a small Etsy store to sell some prints on. The prints are for digital art that I've made and it probably took me an average of 10 hours to make each piece. I'm wondering what advice you all might have when it comes to pricing one what a print might sell for. I was thinking along the lines of a $15 for one, $20 for 2, and $25 for 3 but I'm new to this so any feedback would be appreciated.Art Prints Pricing"
Etsy,"Hellllo, I've tried looking this up online and even through the Etsy help centre but I've not gotten anywhere, so I hope someone can help. **It's a two part query really and the second part is the most important.**

I just don't really understand the basket features.

**Part 1** \--

People on the Etsy forum say that anyone who adds an item to their basket will accumulate and when you hit a threshold, Etsy will add a line to your listing to say, 'Over 20 people have this in their basket' (for example). Apparently an item in a basket is held for 30 days before emptying automatically.

But this can't be true. This caption comes and goes almost randomly on my listings. My most popular product always has the most baskets, so there must be some accurate calculation involved, but sometimes it just disappears completely. It's unlikely the 30-day period of all 20+ baskets expires on the same day. I also have products that say, '10 people have this in their basket' or '3 people...' so even if some *do* expire, why does the caption all but disappear and not just lower the number?

**Part 2** \--

The second and most important part of my query is that *if this is the case*, what constitutes an 'Abandoned basket'? Because I've had a coupon set up for over 2 years to offer any abandoned baskets 15% off, but according to my account it has only ever emailed out 1 email with this coupon. I get the 'Over 20 people...' thing all the time, so if it clears, people must be abandoning their baskets...?

Why then is Etsy not offering the coupon?How do baskets and abandoned baskets work? [2 queries]"
Etsy,"Hi, 

My boyfriend and I just made two regulation size cornhole boards.  We want to decorate them and paint them oursleves. We are looking for pretty simple stencils, things like lobsters or pineapples or a cactus. It can be anything really as long as it's large, and doesn't require layering of various stencils.  We'd love it if they were complimentary.  So think like gryffindor/slyhtherin, but with more common things that won't seem dated in 10 years. It can be food  animals, or other items, or even shapes or patterns that we can do in complimentary colours. I know this is a bit vague as we don't know exactly what stencils we want.

Etsy,"I purchased an item that I didn't realize was a preproduction back in early January. Seller reached out to me and told me that the item would be shipping out at the end of January, explaining a bit of the situation. I had no problems with this at all, I'm a patient person. 

I waited until the end of January with no word and ended up reaching out to see if there were any updates, seller then proceeded to tell me that they would be going out first week of January, as they just found a supplier to print the item. That wasn't a problem for me at all. 

The seller ended up including in my update that they had stated in the kickstarter that there would be additional shipping tacked on and they had listed shipping as free on Etsy because that was the only way the site actually promotes an item.

This was a bit frustrating to me, as I put the item on my credit card and planned for a specific price point. I told them this and that I wasn't really sure what they expected me to do as the item was listed as free shipping. They told me that they would be shipping out the item and I could pay it back whenever. 

The item shipped out today, two months past when I paid for it and I have an email asking for shipping to be sent to venmo or cash app. 

I feel bad because the item was already in the process of being made when they informed me of the shipping, they were made to order items. I didn't fund it on kickstarter, I purchased it on etsy with shipping included. The store said they would have loved to cover the cost but they wouldn't make any money that way so I'm torn on what to do.

Should I find something to sell to make up the shipment or am I in the right that they had free shipping and I don't need to send the 16 more dollars? Money is tight at the moment and I budgeted for the price of the item specifically.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated 😞Seller wants shipping after purchase because it was stated in a Kickstarter?"

Etsy,"Soap opera / drama alert

The product I’m selling on Etsy isn’t groundbreaking, and even though I was the only shop selling them when I first started last year, I kinda knew that it’s only a matter of time that other sellers would start popping up.

So yes - a few months later, shops selling similar products started appearing. I know I can’t control the actual product itself, but there was a couple shops with very similar photography style which was annoying. It’s not exactly plagiarism, so I couldn’t technically do anything.

Then a few weeks ago I found one who literally copied and pasted my description into their own, using the same exact sentences and format to describe the product. They changed literally only a few words here and there, but the rest is an exact replica. I know that it’s just words and it’s nothing compared to people plagiarizing art and stuff, but reading my own voice and language on another person’s listing is just weird.

So I contacted them really nicely, saying, “hey I noticed that bla bla bla... Imitation is the best flattery and I appreciate you taking inspiration from my listing, but it's very clear that some of your descriptions have been literally copied and pasted (with a little modification) from my listing. My work is not like any other amazing artwork here that needs legal copyright protection, but outright and direct copying has never sat right with me. As a fellow Etsy seller, I am respectfully asking you to honor each other's work, originality, and uniqueness, because this community is only possible through all of those things. I hope that you will find the time to craft something new and original, which can start from your listing description. We are more creative than we think :)”

They responded, “I took language and directions from [the internet]. We are selling the same products so our language will be similar.”

Me: *Proceeded to take screenshots and annotated all the exact wording in red. Also, at this point I just realized that, this person was a PREVIOUS buyer who gave me 5-star review and offered to ‘promote’ my shop on their Instagram page*

Them: “Again, we are both selling the same products. The language will have similarities. I cannot change the the properties of [product] or the benefits of using [product]. If you watch any videos or read articles, the language used is similar. This can be found across the internet. I use the same language in my posts on social media. The Language is common. I did not copy your text.”

Me: “I'm not talking about similar language. I'm talking about exact, word-by-word, copy-and-paste. Yes, I do watch and read articles, but find me another source in the internet that uses these exact wordings but my listings. *(gave more examples of the exact same sentences and format)*

I tried to be nice, but it's almost insulting that you wouldn't at least admit that you took some inspiration from my listing. I can't believe you used to offer to advertise my shop on your Instagram if I were to have an IG account for this shop, and now you've decided to just completely stole everything.

I will take the high road and end this here. I hope you think twice the next time you're copying someone, as much as you don't want to admit it. Have a good one.”


They didn’t respond, but a couple hours later I noticed them change their description. Still not completely original, but it’s a step.


I guess I’m just bummed at people like this who wouldn’t even admit their mistakes. And if this is what I went through with words, I can’t imagine what it’d be like with more ‘expert’ copycats who steal people’s artworks, technology, brands, etc. Seeing other shops selling similar products to mine has forced me to innovate and diversify my product line, which is beneficial for me and the bigger market, but copycats are just annoying as hell and I just wanted to let off some steam.

I know on Etsy that there are Sellers who are able to print pictures on plush fleece blankets. My grandpa passed away right before the pandemic in January 2020 and my grandma passed away a couple weeks ago, February 15, 2021, due to COVID. 

My aunt and mom has been taking my grandma’s passing really hard since they tried their best to keep her safe from the virus.. Unfortunately the virus found its way to my grandma and caused pneumonia in her lungs. She fought hard until the end and I believe that my grandpa told her to let go so  that he can be with her again &lt;3

Well, to get to my point, I am looking for a Seller that can print a a single photo of my grand parents in their prime years and send it out to two different addresses; SeaTac, WA and Longview, WA. I am not sure if that is an option on Etsy.

I think I can do it on Shutterfly, but I would rather support an Etsy Seller for this project because I know the quality will be made with care rather than a bigger business just taking orders, if that makes sense.

If anyone has any recommendations, please let me know the name of the Etsy Seller/Company.

Etsy,"Hi all,

I was notified by a paralegal at a law firm that I was selling something that involved a copyright infringement.  While I don't understand how it violates the copyright, I of course took the listing down immediately while looking into it.  I certainly never want to violate someone's rights!  Here is the info, that I was sent...

""Our client has not authorized you to use the phrase “Christmas Forget the Milk and Cookies got Wine?”, which is confusingly similar to the “got milk?” trademark and tarnishes the “got milk?” brand. Specifically, it is apparent here that you intended to capitalize on the good will created by our client’s world famous “got milk?” marks by using the phrase in a slightly manipulated manner to which is insufficient to eliminate the likelihood of confusion. Further, even if this product does not create any confusion about its source or affiliation with our client’s “got milk?” marks, our client is protected from trademark dilution by tarnishment. Here, you use a twist on our client’s famous mark to discourage the consumption of milk, the very reason the brand was created, and instead to encourage the consumption of alcohol. This is an attempt to tarnish our client’s famous “got milk?” marks for you and your company to make a profit.""

While, I don't entirely agree, it is probably better to just leave it unlisted and move on.  Just not worth it.  I'm mostly posting this as information in case it might help another seller who might also be selling an item using this phrase. However, as in everything you make your own decisions about what to do with your own product listings, I am just sharing the information.Copyright infringement? ""Got Milk"""
Etsy,"I have a few questions i want to be certain about.

1. From etsy guidelines of which type of websites are prohibited from being an affiliate program: 
""Sites that exist solely or predominately to promote Etsy items""

Okay, i get it. There must be value. But then i look at obvious affiliate sites such as www.thisiswhyimbroke.com, and i wonder: doesnt these guys do exactly that? Or are they let off the hook because of the other products listed (Amazon is one of their affiliate), if not just for them being popular and driving good amounts of traffic. Yes, they write short descriptive texts - but is that really enough to bypass this rule? Because i am interested in doing likewise in another niche, not only with affiliate products, and i dont want to get shut down immediately. 

To me it sounds uneven, and from the looks of many etsy affiliate sites out there, it is uneven.

Etsy,"So I just sold my first item and now I’m panicking because when I set up the listing I selected Etsy shipping, but now that the time has come to send out the item, what do I do? Will the post office know?How does etsy shipping work?"
Etsy,"Greetings, 

I work as a personal shopper sometimes. I bought from a seller in the USA some Kyara agarwood chips (0.5 gram tiny jar), and gave him the address of my customer so he can send it to him. I choose the fastest shipping and asked him to confirm it was the fastest because the customer needs it ASAP. He then confirmed it the fastest, and will be shipped through DHL.

 

So, what's the issue you say? He took almost a week to even prepare a shipping label for this expedited shipping service. And he only issued the shipping label after I sent him a friendly message asking him that I want to cancel the order because my customer backed out on me, and can't pay me back because of the recent weather consequences on him and his family. He ignored my message completely, and issued a shipping label after three hours to cover himself, then took three days just to hand DHL the package.

 

The item itself as he mentioned in the details, already comes cut from his Japanese source, and he further cut them and put them in two tiny jar sizes for long storage times. So, it's not a matter of special personalised item. It's already cut and prepared in advance. Also, I learned later that he charges five times the amount compared to the other sellers on Etsy for the same product which is always in demand. So that tells a little something about him. 

 

The customer told me he received the package, and will send it back to the seller. I know the fault lies with me in part of this, but I trusted my customer, and thought the seller had some compassion too. So how can I proceed now? Thanks.

 

Tl;dr : I bought a non personalised item for someone. He told me he couldn't pay me back for it because of special circumstances. I asked the seller to cancel. He ignored me and immediately issued a shipping label. The seller is in the USA, the item was sent to a German customer in Germany.Seller refuses to refund and to accept a return.."

I did tell the seller about the bugs, and she said it would be ok, that the bugs will die off but I can put the skull in water so the bugs will die, just to be safe.

Etsy,I know I've only been open since August but is there anyway I can boost my sales. I just recently ran onto a trademark issue with Lush Cosmetics and when I went to change everything it wouldn't let me re activate my product. So I had to take the listing down and relist it. So now because my mascara was my biggest seller and I had to take down all the sales I had on it my shop says I only have 4 sales and I know that some consumers look at that stuff what do I do any advice would be great I went from 10 sales down to 4.Boosting Sales?

Etsy,"Hi all, hopefully this is a good place to ask. 

I’ve been wanting to purchase a rug from Morocco from Etsy. (I live in the US)

However, i have no idea how to navigate paying duties? How to not get it held up in customs? How expensive the import will be (I’ve done multiple calculators and some say it will cost nothing bc it’s under 800 US dollars. And some say I will owe upward of 500 dollars for import)

I can’t find any clear info about how I deal with this stuff. It’s all very convoluted. 

Does anyone have an experience about importing into the US. 

DO I EVEN NEED TO DO ANYTHING? will it just magically arrive? 

Sorry for the dumb dumb question. Any help is appreciated:)

Etsy,"This is the worst shipping issue I've ever had. In my experience with PE, about 25% arrive one day late. I've never had any arrive later than that, and this is the first one that's ever been lost. 

WORST part? The buyer, knowing they were ordering last minute, had it sent to the location they were traveling to, which actually gave the order an extra 3 days to arrive. When it didn't, she was there for a few days, so later was good too. So, even a very very late delivery, would still have been totally fine (she just needed it to be there). I am devastated that it didn't arrive in time, but am so relieved to be working with one of the kindest buyers I have ever had. 

I refunded, she reordered, and all is good on that end.

I filed an insurance claim on USPS. I'm just really shocked it hasn't been found. I thought PE packages were on another level. The last scan was at my own distribution center.Priority Mail Express Order LOST"

So I’ve been on Etsy since November and I was selling just sticker packs until recently when I started making 420 friendly resin art too. I hadn’t really had any issues with customers in the early part but I have read a load of your horror stories about customers lying/scamming etc. Due to the price of my stickers I didn’t think it was worth the cost of signed for post as it’s literally half the price of the stickers and I don’t charge postage. 
Recently I’ve had a massive influx of customers saying they didn’t get their orders but other people who were sent out with those letters have had theirs weeks before? 
Like I get one or two that get lost in post I’m not worried about those but like 5-10 is a joke right? 
What can I do? I don’t have the cash to stay afloat As I’ve put everything into this already and now I’m waiting for a return. Please can someone help me!!!!

Etsy,"I recently moved my shop because of some complicated things and had to start fresh. Which meant leaving almost 100 five star reviews, which are very important to customers. But I was looking forward to getting rid of the few bad reviews, which weren't for very reasonable reasons. I was so excited to see that my first review was a five! Then my heart sank as I saw that the same person left two four star reviews. With my old shop I might be a little let down and just move on, it's a lot better than anything below that. But then I noticed that my shop now showed 4.5 stars filled. As an Etsy customer myself, I know this is not good for bringing new customers, many have a full five stars to brag. I messaged the person right after they reviewed asking them anything I can do to improve their experience and have yet to receive a reply. I'm so bummed that someone would do that to a new shop... They could at least say what was wrong! Now all I can hope for is that my other customers bring the score up to five.

I always include measurements in every listing. I don’t really understand how people could miss this. Maybe they don’t measure or visualize how big the pendant is?
My question is: do any of you have experience with this? I always process the returns once I receive the item but...I hate returns. In your option, is returning an item because ‘it’s too big’ a valid reason? Or should I restrict the returns only if it’s damaged?

In the future I will definitely be asking if there is a deadline when the order is marked as a gift. Should I respond directly to her comment explaining my position?

I bought an item from Israel back in November of 2020 (Black Friday Weekend) which had been shipped on December 2nd, 2020. I received a tracking number and waited for the estimated arrival time which was between late December and early January. I had received one tracking update for the whole time. Just before the estimated arrival time was up, I got in touch with the seller and they told me that some packages had been returned due to a mistake in the mail - They sent me pictures of the packages and told me they would re-ship with a new tracking number.

Etsy,"Hello everyone,

I have had an etsy store for several years now, as a part-time thing. Recently I encountered this strange situation, and I was wondering if anyone has ever experienced something similar, or has   
any advice on how to handle it.

So- right when I first started my etsy I made a custom-made item for a customer which was very intricate and for which, in hindsight, I was probably underpaid. Recently that same customer messaged me a picture of this item, and asked if I could make him something similar. He had apparently forgotten that I was the person who originally made him that item. I replied, explaining that I had made it, and asking why he wanted another copy of it.

He then seemed to remember me, and explained that he had gifted the original item to a friend, and now regretted it. Finding this kind of strange, I googled his name and soon found a website selling many items in the same category as mine (I'm trying to be vague), where mine was also listed as 'SOLD'. He had sold my item for 4x the amount I charged, and I suspect he was planning to do this again. I replied with a link to the website, asking if he re-sold my item and expressing that I felt uncomfortable about him doing so without being honest about it, and never got a proper reply. 

Does anyone know if this goes against Etsy's policies? I feel uncomfortable about the whole situation (especially the dishonesty), but I'm not sure if this is actually abnormal

Thanks!Customer re-sold an item bought from me"

When I check their order it shows it has been refunded by Etsy (Etsy covered the refund), however a case was never opened on the package. I'm thinking they must have contacted Etsy via email or something.

Etsy,"I make cosplay armor pieces, just had my 150 sale today (yay). Unfortunately, it was with an annoying customer whose order I originally canceled back in January. This guy ordered a piece back then but did not provide me with the required measurements so I could even start the build. Yes, I have the listing set up to require this info in the personalization field and it's quite clear which measurements I need. No, I can't use the Variations as they limit you to 2 and I required 3-5 measurements, depending on the item.

  
For some reason, this guy didn't provide them in the personalization field and just typed in ""done."" I contacted him within 10 minutes of his order on Etsy to ask for the measurement and never got a response. I messaged him twice more on the platform that week, emailed him one time and evern found him on Facebook due to their unusual name and tried to reach them there. After 2 weeks I canceled their order and refunded the payment.

  
I have to assume they are simply an idiot as they ordered the exact same piece of armor again today, and this time put in the personalization field ""I can fit it inside my arms.""...like...wtf does that even mean. And he must have seen my 3 previous polite messages from January asking for measurement.

  
I messaged him within 5 minutes of the order today, to very politely state I needed the measurement and I didn't understand what he meant by ""I can fit it inside my arms."" Haven't heard back. I am not going to try any further, he gets one week to get his head out of his ass and send the measurements then I'm canceling and refunding the order. AGAIN.

Etsy,"So I’m trying to decide whether or not to sell dreadlock/hair accessories individually or in a pack of say, 3.

I honestly don’t mind either way, but was curious if people would be more apt to buy just 1 wire hair wrap, or if they’d prefer a pack (because I mean they are a bit on the smaller side!) 

I would think people prefer packs, because you tend you want to decorate your hair with more then 1 accessory piece. 

But, I’m new to Etsy so I’m not sure whether people there prefer to buy multiples or singles of a hair accessory.

Feedback is welcomed(:Selling in singles or selling in packs?"
Etsy,"Ok so let me explain. I have my shop setup to encourage the buyer to purchase multiple items. I do this by offering all of my buyers free shipping on orders over $40 CAD or if they purchase any 2 items in my shop. The shipping cost does not change for me or changes very little because my items do not weigh very much so it is much more cost effective to encourage them to buy more.

My dilemma is this: Over half of my shoppers qualify for free shipping but I also send the majority of my parcels with untracked air parcel. With the way the world is currently working I would love if everyone chose to upgrade their shipping to tracked parcel. Of course I offer upgraded shipping but it only offers it to my customers at the full price without factoring in the free shipping discount I already have in place if they qualify for free shipping.

For example, I charge a flat rate of $10 on all orders under $40. Buyer A buys an order worth $20 and Buyer B buys $40 worth of product. Buyer A and B both will get my standard shipping option but Buyer A will pay $10 in shipping while Buyer B received it for free. 

I also offer tracked, express shipping for a flat rate of $18. Both customers have the option to upgrade to my tracked method but Buyer A has the option to upgrade for only $8 more than they are already paying for postage but as Etsy currently has their system setup Buyer B needs to pay the full $18 to upgrade.

Is there a way to offer Buyer B the option to upgrade their shipping while factoring in my free shipping and only charging them $8 more?

Etsy,"I'm working on a new listing and looking for some advice. The item in question will be a layered, paper pieced artwork and I'd like to have the option to sell it unframed or framed.

Unframed it can be shipped in a flat rigid mailer for a fairly decent shipping price. However framed in a shadowbox, it will need to be packed/shipped in a box as a parcel and the shipping will obviously be higher.

My question is: is there any way to have 2 shipping profiles for one listing? I know I can do the variations for the framed and unframed options, but both options are using single shipping info provided so either the shipping cost will be too high for unframed or too low for framed (or vice versa) depending on how I set it up.

If having multiple profiles for 1 listing isn't an option, any advice on how I might set this up?

Would it make more sense to just set it as unframed but have a frame as an add-on listing with the appropriate shipping? Or should I just forgo offering a frame and sell it as is with info on the type of frame needed? TIA!Can you have more than 1 shipping profile for a listing?"

I'd like some input on how to point out to non experts, this seller is selling diseased plants because, they are just someone flipping plants with zero knowledge most likely (I have no reason to believe they are intentionally dumping damaged/ill stock on people) and how their plants will probably arrived damaged given they have zero concept on how to pack a plant to ship.

So immediately after I posted this I responded with a big whole long thing with USPS's FAQ, saying I'll submit a missing mail search, it should take 2-3 days etc. If we can't find it I will be happy to send a new one once I hear from the USPS about the status (mind you, the package has already been marked as delivered, as per my previous post).

Got an answer back saying (paraphrased) ""I checked everywhere, this has happened before with other packages, USPS sucks and this always happens. So I need information."" 

They sent me this message at about 10PM my time... I wasn't checking my phone. 

Got another message an hour later with them saying ""they are in the dark without me"" and ""needed to know the information of the package""

I responded soon as I woke up (which is still technically out of my business hours) telling them once again I have submitted the case and gave them all the details of the package (the tracking number, 1st class, etc. WHICH should have auto-filed if they inputted the tracking number into the USPS site... but whatever). Asked them what other information they needed.

Fast forward 4 days, still no call from the USPS but I'm not surprised. It's taken a whole week after first contact for them to call me. Well, buyer left a 1-star review saying ""Never got the item.""

I am SO upset over this. I've done so much to try to help but 1. the buyer hasn't been clear what they need from me and 2. I am literally doing everything I can save just giving them their money back (WHICH I OFFERED TOO, I said ""I can refund you or send a new one once I hear from the USPS, depending on what I find out from them. It just depends on what you want at that time), and they said ""oh yeah it's not your fault"" and then leaves me a 1 star review???

I've reported it to Etsy and this point I'm done. Maybe I'm being an asshole seller but as far as I'm concerned at this point the package was delivered. When I get the call from the USPS I'll figure out what happened to the package and send the buyer the info, but at that point I'm done.

Etsy,"Hi all! First time post here. I sell polymer clay earrings and at first I was putting them into little pouches directly in Kraft bubble mailers, but I felt that it looked ugly and wasn’t well protected so I blew a bunch of money on small boxes, earring cards and cellophane sealed bags. 
I’m in Montreal, Canada and when deciding on whether to buy boxes or not, I checked the rates for shipping to the US and it was the same price and the bubble mailer (8$) so I bought 100 boxes on uline. 
I get to the post office to mail out my first box to New Brunswick and it ended up costing me 15$. 
I charge $5 shipping in Canada and 7$ shipping in the US, so I took a $10 loss with that sale, but no loss for the US orders. 
Should I continue to use the boxes since they look more professional and hope that most of my orders come from the US, or switch back to bubble mailers?

Sorry if this is long winded and worded weirdly, it’s late and I’m tired heheShipping: boxes or bubble mailers?"
Etsy,"Hey, I run a skateboarding engraving business on Etsy. Recently an order came thru as a gift for her dad. He owns a screen printing business so she wanted to get him something special. 

I have it stated in my description that all of my engravings are done on the top of the board. I kept in contact with her throughout the way- sent her pictures of the final product and she had no issues with it. 
This morning she gave me a 5 star review with a happy picture of her dad with the board.

A couple hours later, her dad messaged me on my facebook telling me that I engraved the wrong side- and being rather blunt and rude. 

I explained that it is stated in my description which side will be engraved AND that I do that for a particular reason (so you can still shred it up). His daughter didn’t tell me that it needed to be placed on the bottom.

This was a fully custom piece, it honestly took me about 40 hours with all of the tedious design, and printing which had major hiccups. 

He is now asking how much it would cost to receive a new “correct” board. He said that he can send the current board back, but I have no use for it. I cant use it, or sell it because it was a custom piece. 
I don’t accept returns or exchanges on custom products- and there isn’t anything wrong with the board other than being on the wrong side. 

I guess I am not sure how to approach this. I sell my custom boards for $100 each- should I offer him a new one at a discounted price? 
Should I just ask he pay shipping and supplies? 
Should I tell him that I just don’t accept returns or exchanges on custom pieces?

I think this could get messy if I go against my shop policies and outside of etsy- but he already seems like he could be very rude if I say no. I was honestly so happy to be done with this project because it was so stressful. I dont want to have to do a round 2.... What do you think I should do?Buyer Wants Exchange on Custom Piece"
Etsy,"Hi, I recently was trying to think of different ways of packaging jewelry that i’m going to be making and selling on etsy, and I was wondering out of these two options which sounds better. (each option will have the logo stamped onto the cloth pouches that the jewelry would be going into, and come with a thank you and jewelry care card). also any other ideas or suggestions are welcome. i tried to do a lot of research about this but i am still very new to it :)

Option 1: Small cloth pouch wrapped with kraft paper in a small box, and a wax stamp on top to seal it. and that would go into a small bubble mailer. 

Options 2: The same small cloth pouch but wrapped in kraft paper with wax seal and put that into the bubble mailer. (basically option one but without the box)

i’m not sure which one to do because option 1 would maybe be more protective, but option 2 would cut down on cost and waste of the packaging, and also making the shipping cost slightly less. and i didn’t know if just the pouch and kraft paper itself would be enough because i have seen people do that in videos i have watched while researching. i could maybe even start off with the no box option to save some money when starting out and eventually purchase boxes.Question about what kind of packaging I should have for jewelry."
Etsy,"Okay so I am upset. I purchased what I thought was a handblown glass humming bird feeder from a seller on Etsy and the item came to me in an amazon box with an amazon gift receipt. 

Had I know this could be purchased on amazon I would have done so myself and saved the markup from the Etsy seller. This is besides the point however, I was trying to buy something that was handmade by an artist NOT handmade in CHINA.

I guess I am doubly upset because I am a seller on Etsy that has to put up with resellers selling items that they purchased from wholesalers that are not truly handmade and as a buyer / huge supporter of Etsy artist this just gets under my skin.Humming Bird Feeder from AMAZON"

Etsy,"i dont know if this is the right sub for this, but i bought a jpeg to a poster on some etsy shop- the quality wasnt really what i expected, so i wrote that down in the review as a flaw.

my issue now is that this all seems extremely sketchy and im lowkey scared that theyre gonna send me some virus if i give them my email.

Etsy,"Hello everyone! I'm currently looking into starting an etsy shop, but i feel like a lot of the tips i see are geared towards sellers who sell made-to-order items, who can easily fill up their shops with different designs, customization options etc.   


I make small furniture out of reclaimed wood, and i also dabble in some upcycling. For instance, i make cat/dog beds out of old drawers or dining chairs. Most of the things i make are one of a kind, since the design depends on the materials that are available.   


I feel like my biggest hurdle to overcome is filling up my shop. At a given moment i might only have 3-4 projects that are for sale, which is not enough to make my shop look remotely interesting.

Etsy,"Does any one have advice on a simple way to get bookmarks printed in UK? All the printers I have been researching want printer ready pdf files and cmyk. I have been spending many hours trying to produce this 'printer ready file' but feel I don't have the knowledge to do it myself, even though I know exactly what I want on the bookmarks. Surely there must be an easier way? Unfortunately, the fabulous printer I use for my cards, who makes it really easy to design them online, does not do bookmarks. I just drop a jpg into the template and it automatically sizes and does the rest.

I thought Canva might be a solution, but have found so many printers complaining about people submitting these and that they are no good for printing so that seems a dead end.

They (printers) also want me to buy far too many bookmarks in one design. This is a new venture for me and I wanted to get a variety of designs (about 10-12) and only about 10 of each printed without spending a fortune. This way I can test the market. I think I have been spoilt by my card printer where you can buy 100 cards in 20 different designs and get same discount as if you were buying 100 cards in one design.

Etsy,"The question is often raised: ""why are there so many dropshippers and resellers of Chinese goods on Etsy""?

Based on my supplies shops, I can say this: Etsy buyers conduct less due diligence on price and source than other marketplace buyers (Bonanza, eBay, Amazon). Some of these goods I know are not competitive with sellers on eBay because of the need to price in Offsite Ads Fees, yet they still sell. While some of those buyers may have wanted to purchase from me, I know many arrive via offsite ads and simply buy the first thing they see. I appreciate the sales, but this can be a dangerous game for other types of goods that are ""fake handmade"" items or dropshipped from overseas without any seller involvement. Why is it dangerous to have buyers do this?

\- Etsy's ML models gain more data of the A/B tests which were running when that sale was made. If the description was completely collapsed and there was no title, and a sale was made, Etsy is now likely to present that test to additional users.

\- The sellers of cheap Chinese made goods or dropshippers gain more economic incentive to relist those same items, or list new items. Their items get better search rank by increasing sell-through volume.

So, as an Etsy buyer, you can make Etsy a better marketplace by:

1. Expand the description of the item you wish to purchase
2. Do a reverse image search on your item to verify it is not a resold cheap item. Try using TinEye or searching for the item on AliExpress.
3. Check out the buyer's profile. Is the seller based in the country they are shipping the goods from? Do they have a website?

Etsy has given up trying to police these types of sellers, so by conducting due diligence, you can elevate the real handmade sellers.Etsy buyers have a responsibility to conduct due diligence on the items they are buying"

Etsy,"I’m having problems with a seller that I’ve ordered from before, and I don’t know how to proceed. I’ve ordered at least 9 items from this shop over the years, including 6 dresses this year. I’ve spent over 1,000 USD at this shop this year alone. I love this shop so much, and I think they make unique, well-made,  comfortable and flattering clothes. That’s why I want to come up with a solution that will be mutually satisfactory.

I received 3 dresses in my most recent order, and I’m not happy with two of them. Essentially, the items are not what is pictured in the listing. Both dresses have a similar style: a solid colour with  contrasting fabric around the neck and the bottom of the sleeves. However, both dresses have a huge stripe of the contrasting fabric over “ruching” on the hips. I think it really takes away from the style of the dress. I double checked the pictures (including buyer pics of the item) and none have the extra contrasting fabric on the hips. I’m honestly really puzzled how this happened, because none of their items have this style so it’s not even like it’s a mix up of the order. 

In addition, one of the dresses has a scoop neck and there is an incredibly sloppy seam on one shoulder (think a big hunk of serge fabric twisted and sewed upwards).

I’ve written to the seller, and included picture, as well as screen shots from their listing asking how to proceed... and I haven’t received a response in more than 24 hours.

This is an established shop with 30,000+ sales. Do I open a case? Ideally, I’d like to get these items replaced/fixed, if it could be done quickly. However, it took 4 months (!) to get my order and the dresses have long sleeves so will soon be out of season. I’m also worried that returning them is going to be a huge hassle to get taxes/duty back, because it’s something from the US and I live in Canada. Does anyone have any advice on the best outcome for me might be?

I am also aware that this is a small business and I don’t want to be a difficult customer. However, I’m so disappointed with my order that I’ve been eagerly awaiting for months.

I’d really appreciate any advice you might have.

Etsy,"I shipped a sticker to a customer using my standard method of shipping, 1st class letter. The customer contacted me a few days after that and told me they had not received the order yet. I checked my Etsy order page and saw that it was delivered. I figured it must have been misdelivered, asked them to verify their address, they verified, and I promptly shipped a replacement to them. 

Delivery issue seldom happens, so I don't mind sending a replacement. Instead of using USPS 1st class letter, I used USPS 1st class package with a real USPS tracking number.  In my message to them, I apologized and included the link to the replacement's USPS tracking page.

Last week, they placed another order. I checked the replacement order tracking, and it showed delivered, so I assumed that the customer liked it so much they wanted another one. To confirm, though, I sent a message to the customer saying that I saw they placed a new order and if they received their replacement. I didn't receive a reply from the customer, so I thought no news is good news and shipped off the new order using USPS 1st class package the following day.

Today, the customer contacted me saying they have not received any stickers yet and to give them tracking numbers. I again linked both USPS tracking numbers. I explained the replacement's tracking showed that it was delivered to a mailbox. The 2nd order showed in transit, but late so I explained it must be the winter storm causing the delay. I'm currently waiting for the buyer to message me back.

I feel like I'm being taken for a ride due to all the posts about sellers getting scammed. I'm tempted to refund all monies, take the loss, and block the buyer from my shop. What would you do?

In this customers review, this called me a jerk, creepy, crazy and threatened to call the cops on me if I contacted her again. To be fair, the only contact I had with her is responding to a message she sent me about the product (where I literally copied-and-pasted part of the listing description and said thank you to her), before she left me negative feedback.

Etsy,"So, I'm trying to create a new product, which is a printable planner. I was planning on offering both A5 and A4, A5 is all done, but as I was trying to combine the A4 pages into 1 pdf (399 pages) it won't let me...

What I did with the A5 was get a pdf merger and place the pages for 1 month in order and save that. Then create a new pdf with that file 12 times and add the cover and other pages. 

But with A4, the files are bigger and when I tried to add the file with the month pages, it told me the file was too big. I've tried every pdf merger I could find and all say the same...

I tried compressing the pdf, but I felt like the quality wasn't the same when I zoomed in.

I don't want to sell the worst quality version, but I also don't know what to do. Maybe add all the files in one folder and state in the instructions that you need to print one of the files 12 times?

I gift a lot of handknit items to people, and I always want to try to make care instructions as easy as possible. I'd love to find a place that sells tiny samples of wool wash/detergent in bulk to give to people with those gifts, so that they can use that to wash their items a few times. Something like those little triangle packets. 

Does anyone who sells on Etsy do this for their customers? Where in the world might I find a place that I can get those in bulk? I've been searching but am having trouble finding anything that's both reasonably priced and doesn't look like a cheap overseas knockoff version of wool wash.

Etsy,"Last night I purchased a watch from a seller in Sri Lanka. This morning the seller contacted me and said there was a problem with the payment, could they refund my purchase price and would I repurchase the item? 

I have looked around a bit and can't find any scam that matches this setup. Is this familiar to anyone? It seems very fishy, and I'm inclined to say no, get my refund and cut bait. TIA!

UPDATE: Seller has refunded the original amount (confirmed in PP), and is asking me to purchase via a new link from the same Etsy shop. She said the original payment was 'limited' or restricted by PayPal for too many transactions. I have asked her if the new payment will go through via PayPal, and why the watch is now seven dollars less expensive. Another odd detail is there is only one watch in stock, but it is in 10 etsy carts...assuming this is a sales pressure tactic?

UPDATE 2: The seller has removed the link to the watch, but it shows up in the shop as a completed sale. She has not replied since that happened. Hmm... It's possible she is just new at this (only 3 sales total) and is legit struggling. Unfortunately, it can be interpreted as scammy behavior as well. Thank you for the advice so far!

UPDATE 3: The seller removed the link and replied that the watch was sold to someone else. Weird. I got my refund as promised, though, so other than a few wasted minutes, I'm out nothing. It actually worked out better for me as I was able to find a variant of the watch I like better from another vendor.

Etsy,"I thought I would update you all about this:

https://www.reddit.com/r/Etsy/comments/ljcm3n/the_order_that_keeps_on_giving/

I wrote this at the weekend.  The back story and history is there.  

It was a scam.  I don't have anything official to tell me it was a scam but I know now it was a scam. 

The I don't know if he engaged with etsy when the case was open.  I don't know if he engaged in the trust and safety process. 

Anyways etsy refunded me and then the seller started sending me messages. I got two and thank goodness no more. 

He claimed he sent the item to me mid week of last week.   Only that he never informed me of that when the case was open.  He left it til the case was closed and refunded.

I bought from an Irish seller and I am in Ireland and so it would have been a national post item. 

Post in Ireland is usually quick 1 to 3 days.  It doesn't usually take long. 

The seller claimed in one of the messages that he sent the item to me mid week of last week.  I would consider mide week to be Wednesday or Thursday.  

There was no parcel from him in the mail to me at any stage sent then - Friday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and today on Thursday.  No mail.   That's 5 working days.  Nothing showed up from him. 

I made other online orders last week and I got other stuff arrive to me in the mail.  Like one order was dispatched on Thursday and delivered to me on Friday.  Another order was dispatched yesterday and delivered to me today. 


Its just after hitting me now that the seller was a scammer.   I had my doubts before now.  I don't get it though. Its so weird and such an elaborate scam because he did have the item for me and he did send it before the Christmas but it was broken.   If all he wanted to do was scam money out of people you would think, he wouldnt have anything to post people. The only thing I can think of was if the item was stolen or he was using a child's woodwork project from school and the school is closed so couldn't repair it.  I haven't a clue. It was a scam.An update to the scam"
Etsy,"I am wanting to sell SVG/DXF/PNG/AI files. My files are extremely detailed and complex because they are made of lots of tiny pieces that fit together in one piece like [this](https://i.imgur.com/QjREOcE.png). I know that if you open a DXF in Illustrator, it preserves its layers. Each color is on a layer and that's how I want it, but I know not everyone has Illustrator. Is there a free alternative to Illustrator that would preserve layers?  


To better explain, [this](https://i.imgur.com/dExNTeY.png) is what the file looks like. Each outline is a different cut, and each color is on a different layer (for 22 different layers total). If I just import the DXF straight to Silhouette Studio or the SVG to Design Space, the separate layers will not be there.

I can't just export the layers as separate files, either. I want this to be fully scalable and there's no way to scale each of the files to exactly the size they need to be to fit together.Alternatives to .AI?"

Etsy,"I feel like the adjective “reused” for something that is, well, reused, could potentially sound weak, unappealing, a turn off to someone who is buying something handmade.

I LOVE to repurpose things. Mainly because it limits me in a helpful way (being a creative, I have so many ideas that sticking to 1 thing can be challenging), as well as knowing the amount of pollution involved when tossing [still usable] things in the trash.. I just am a pure believer that nothing has just ‘one purpose’. Nothing has purpose until we humans give it a purpose &amp; meaning, so really the amount of purposes are infinite! 

Anyways, what would you recommend be a better term to use instead of “reused” or “repurposed”—Although with “repurposed”, some of the things I use are given the same use, just used differently. Like I’ll take a charm from a necklace and add it to a chain with 20 other charms; still the same use but more so “reused” then “repurposed”.

Or is the term “reused” not a turn off and sounds okay to use?

I also don’t think many people would search the term “reused” because I mean Etsy is a handmade place, not a resell place.Is the term “reused” a turn off to buyers? What could be an alternative word? Recycled? Upcycled? Recovered? Repurposed?"

Etsy,"I’ve been hearing a lot recently about sellers being scammed. Customer saying their item had been marked as delivered but they never got it just so they can get their money back and the free item. I am worried that this is happening to me. 

I’m in Canada and I was shipping my handmade oven mitts to the UK. It’s only been in transit for 10 business days and that’s too soon for it to be delivered

The package also goes as letter mail and is untrackable. The customer chooses this option at checkout because the tracked option is considerably higher priced 

The customer opened a case and said they had not received their item. They said that the royal post had messaged them and said that their order had been delivered and signed for. She said she never signed for anything and the package is missing. She even checked around her backyard and her neighbors. (all the standard things scammer scammer would say. I feel bad because I used to think people were honest but they are not so now I see everyone as dishonest until proven otherwise) 

I informed her it’s too early for her package to be delivered and that the royal post would not have contacted her saying it had been delivered because untracked mail doesn’t have a tracking number or need to be signed for. 

She hasn’t responded yet but I just want to make sure that I’m handling the situation as professionally as I can. I also mentioned that she may have been notified for an additional package from another seller that was tracked

Etsy,"A buyer made a purchase from me in the first week of January as a gift to a friend (who is located in my city). The buyer's location is in another state. I dispatched everything on time and mind you I have shop banners, announcements, listing photos all stating why postal services are delayed. The order was untracked (I provide shipping upgrades as well). 3 weeks pass by and I get the same order from her, now shipping to her location (untracked). I think ""oh, her friend must've liked the item and now she got it for herself, cool!"". 

A few days after her second order she messages me very rudely saying that she ""thinks"" her friend didn't get the order and its been a month. I immediately get a weird feeling and message to say to check mailboxes and not just porches, etc. etc. She says her friend has checked. I reply to say that this is incredibly rare (in fact, has never happened!) that a package has taken so long to arrive in my city. So, I refund the order amount in full since she has waited so patiently.  I was unable to remake the order because they are handmade and take time, and I work alongside and do not have the time  to work on more orders.

Now, this is where things take a curve. I cancel and refund her second order because it is also untracked and I do not want her order to ""not show up"". So, I kindly explain to her that I would be unable to cover the expense if the second order does not show up and I am declining this sale. If she wasn't so rude and belittling, typing in all caps, I would have carried on with her second order. But I decided not to take this customer's crap and declined the second sale. 

She went mad! She told me I'm a scam, that she will report me, etc. I did not reply. Not a minute later, she dings me with a 1-star review that said that I gave no reason as to why her package did not arrive even though it was dispatched a month ago (I did!). She wrote that she doesn't appreciate selling items that don't exist, especially since they are a gift. That it was a waste of time, etc. 

My items do exist and any sane person would know because of my other great reviews and photos with the reviews. I don't understand why she would say they don't exist? 

Anyways, I contacted Live Etsy Support and reported the review citing their policy about third party services. Live support agent looked through the convos and told me I did the right thing to decline the second transaction and to report the review. I have been patiently waiting and today got an email that they won't be taking it down. 

This is the first time I have gotten a  1-star review, and  since Etsy is not taking it down, I would like to know if I even should respond to the review or now. And if I should, what should I even say? I am so drained from this situation. It has made me lose motivation to complete my orders.

I have my shipping fees as free within Canada, products are just slightly marked up. I myself hate paying shipping so figured it would attract more buyers. However a few of my clay earrings broke in the mail as I was simply wrapping them in tissue paper and using a bubble mailer. 

I purchased little boxes to use to ship so they would be protected, however shipping this method is much much more expensive. I do not think my shop is big enough yet to raise the price of the item to accommodate the higher cost and keep it listed as free shipping. But am also worried about backlash and loosing what little business I have by charging 13$ shipping. 

What do you think would be my best option?Shipping cost changes"
Etsy,"I found a beautiful ring I thought was handmade. It came in a custom box and the store had great reviews. I should have known better with the price but I thought they were having a sale and decided to go for it. The ring is 18k  white gold with the band being stamped and the price reflected the gold but not much left over for labor you'd think went into the ring. Instead of going with my better judgment, I assumed because the store was smaller they were trying to gain sales and selling their work short. Also I could not find a similar ring through the search.

However, this morning the same ring I purchased appeared on my suggestion page. I followed it to find this was a different seller from the opposite side of the country as the seller I purchased from. I ended up taking the listing photo and doing a reverse image search (which I should have done from the beginning). Not only did I find the ring on aliexpress for $46 in silver and another for $290 in 18k white gold (several hundred less than I paid) but also several etsy listings with the same ring (which I was unable to find on etsy's search results directly). 

Here's the dilemma. I'm not sure if I should even be upset or not? I do love the ring. If the ring truly is 18k white gold then I do feel I paid a fair price although I could have purchased it cheaper myself. I'm disappointed that it isn't this sellers design like the listing stated and a bit upset to know I'll have to jump through so many hoops in the future to make sure I'm supporting an actual person and their talent. A part of me feels like I deserved to be duped knowing the seller absolutely was not charging for the labor that would have been required.

So my question is what should I do? Should I warn potential customers in a review? Should I message the seller directly? Should I not let it bother me and move on? I feel like it takes away from the sellers with truly handmade items when there are many platforms which this could be sold. It's unfortunate customers are being told it's a custom piece when it's not.Purchase advice"
Etsy,"So hey everyone, I'm an artist looking to start selling on etsy soon. I like doing alot of things from sculpting, painting and drawing so I'm kind of struggling to find a fitting name for my shop, I mostly do cute or creepy stuff. Fantasy, sifi, animals, monsters, but also some fanart and human figures, some of it can be a bit surreal. It would be best if it wasn't too specific and would leave the option open to expand onto selling other things. 

 I would prefer if it had my username in it Alpakachii since I use it on all platforms. I thought about maybe Alpakachii's Corner or Alpakachiis Creatures or something like that, altough the latter seems weird if I also try and sell more normal or fan stuff.

Then secondly, I'm looking for the best ways to package said clay figures or sculptures it probably depends on said figure but I just need some pointers since mailing things is totally new to me. I'm going to start out with smaller stuff at first because it can obviously get expensive. What do you put in the package to keep it safe? There are so many options but I don't want to risk experimenting with actual orders. Shipping is the thing I'm most afraid of seeing as things get lost and or break.

I asked the usual questions about shipping to see if I would send her another one because sometimes items do break in the mail and I would have sent her another out of courtesy. When she sent me a picture of the item I inquired more. I knew her story didn’t add up. She was essentially irresponsible with her item. I sensed she wasn’t being truthful with me.

Quick note, I'm using Canva for all my designs. If I export all my designs as PDF Print files, doesn't the image quality stay the same no matter how large the design is that gets printed (e.g. postcard or poster)?

Etsy,"First, I want to start off by saying I am not a tax professional, so please consult yours if you need help. But I want to help so here are my tips.

Since we are in tax season, I've seen a lot of questions about how to navigate the 1099K they got from Etsy. Most questions relate to the fact that the 1099K numbers don't match what the Etsy Dashboard says they did in sales.

The 1099 shows a GROSS amount. It does not take into account any fees, shipping label purchases, marketing campaigns, etc. It is a total of all the items you sold. So if you sold 1000 shirts for $20 a piece, your 1099 will say $20,000.

Now, let's say you canceled/refunded 2 orders. That would be $40 less gross income. The 1099K will NOT reflect those refunds. So you must subtract any full or partial refunds.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

The Etsy dashboard (Finance Tab -&gt; Payment Account) will show you a couple of pretty pie charts in the Monthly Statements section, one being ""Sales and Credits"" and the other being ""Fee and Taxes"".

The amount shown in Sales and Credits will NOT be your gross amount. Each transaction (not item, this is per payment) charges you 3% of the total payment, plus an additional 25 cents. So your $20 shirt will incur an 85 cent payment processing fee. This money gets taken from you before the money gets to you, so the sales and credit section will say $19.15.

Etsy does not include this payment processing fee in side of the Fee and Taxes section because they don't consider it a fee because it comes off the top before you even metaphorically touch the money.

The Fee and Taxes tab will include listing fees, marketing fees, shipping labels and transaction fee (the 5% fee Etsy charges you to sell on their platform).

&amp;#x200B;

When you are trying to figure out your total income and expenses, you can't use sales and credits number because that is not a true representation of your gross income. In my example above, if you sold 1000 shirts at $20 a piece, your gross income is $20,000. But the sales and credits number will automatically subtract the $850 -&gt; 3% of $20,000 is $600, plus $250 (25 cents x 1000 transactions), so it'll say $19,150.

So if the 1099K isn't fully accurate (unless you know you didn't do a single refund (partial or full) all year, then by all means, use that number), and the cute pie charts in Etsy don't give you your gross sales, then what the heck should you do? This is where the CSV you can download comes into great use.

I am striking all this out for 2 reasons. See below where I pick back up and make a couple changes.

~~Just below the pie charts, it'll give you monthly statements. You're going to want to download each monthly statement for the tax year you're working on (so in this case, all of the statements for 2020) as a CSV. To do this, click on the month, then look for a ""generate CSV"" button on the right. It'll download and will open up in Excel (or whatever program your computer uses to open CSV files).~~

~~Open the file and the first thing you want to do is sort it by ""type"" (column B). To do this, click the B to highlight the entire column. Under the home tab above, look all the way to the right and you should see ""sort and filter"" with a large A and Z above it. Click the button, and select ""sort A to Z"", or ""Z to A"" if you wish. Either works.~~

~~Then it'll ask you if you want to ""expand the selection"". This just means it'll move the entire row to the correct spot vs just moving the cell in column B. You must select ""expand the selection"" for this to work.~~

~~Now each type of even (listing fee, shipping label, etc) will be grouped together. This will make your life much easier.~~

~~To determine your GROSS sales for that month, you will want to add up all the values for the type of transaction called ""sale"". Add all the numbers in column F for this type. Do do this easily, highlight all the cells you want to add and look in the bottom right corner. It'll give you the sum.~~

~~To determine the 3% plus 25 cent payment processing fees you paid that month, you will do the same thing as above, except you'll highlight all the cells in column G. This is an expense you can deduct, just like shipping labels or listing fees.~~

~~If you had any refunds for that month, you will need to do the same thing (add up all in column F then subtract column G).~~

~~To determine your other fees (listing, shipping label, marketing, transaction), highlight values in column G (red is a payment, black is a credit, Excel will do the math for you).~~

~~There are a couple other types that may be confusing, such as ""Payment"". You'll see this if Etsy charged your credit card (or other payment method on file) to pay fees that you didn't have enough money for in your Etsy payment account. This may happen if you issue a refund but don't have enough funds to cover it.~~

~~Then there is the deposit type, which is where you'll see all the deposits to your bank account. This is a nice way to verify the amounts that your bank statements say, but do not use this total for tax purposes, it does not represent your gross sales (remember that you pay any Etsy fees out of your Payment Account, THEN they deposit the leftover money into your bank account.~~

~~You will need to do these steps for each month. After you add all your months, you'll end up with a gross sales, then all your fees to subtract. Remember to subtract other business expenses like supplies and tools.~~

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Okay, so ignore what I crossed out above. It is wrong. The amount (column F) will include sales tax. Etsy is taking that automatically for most states, so you never see that money and it shouldn't be counted as gross anyway. Gross is only the item price and shipping.

The other reason that is there's an easier way to do it.

1. Download the Etsy Payment Sales CSV (Settings -&gt; Download Data).
2. There are a lot of columns. I delete the ones I don't need, but feel free to keep them.
3. Add up column E (Gross Amount). Notice how it is the same number as what your 1099 says? Great.
4. If you did any refunds (partial or complete), you need to subtract those. But Etsy does the work for you by giving you the Adjusted Gross amount in column K. If you did a refund, it'll show the new gross for that sale. So if column E says $15, but column K says $13, you will need to take $2 off your gross to account for the refund. Do this for each time you had a refund. (Note that column Z says refund. This includes any partial sales tax refund that gets automatically given to the buyer. So this is not an accurate measure of your actual refunds).
5. Do the exact same thing for your ""fees"" (which is the payment processing fee). Add up all of column F, those are the total payment processing fees taken by Etsy. And once again, if you gave the buyer a refund, the adjusted fee amount will show up in column L. Do the same thing, subtract any necessary fees.
6. Get the rest of your fees (listing, shipping labels, marketing and transaction fees) from the Etsy Payment Account dashboard under Finance. Use the drop-down menu right above the pie charts to select ""all last year"". On the right it'll give you the totals for each of the categories I mentioned above.

So now you have your gross (1099K value minus refunds) and all your fees (payment processing fee we got in step 5, and all the other fees in step 6).

&amp;#x200B;

I hope this helps you. Please feel free to ask any questions and I'll try to help. I want to restate that I am not a tax professional so please consult your tax service/software or Etsy support if needed.

So I'm learning all about the technical things involved with selling printable wall art on Etsy. Right now, I'm using Canva to make all my designs, and I just watched a video tutorial where the girl said to make sure to download them as PDF prints, because downloading them as JPGs would make the prints be at a lower DPI than what we'd need for high quality prints. That made sense to me, and then I hopped on Easy and saw most people were offering their files in JPG format, which I was told not to do because the DPI would be inadequate.

Anyone know why this might be the case? Are people downloading their designs in PDF Print format and then converting them to JPG? What am I missing here?

Etsy,"Hi everyone,

I've got a bit of a problem, and desperately need some help as it's driving me insane. Seller's perspectives especially might be nice. The ultimate question is 'How do I proceed, to make things happen?'

The short version is: in September 2019, I commissioned a 3D print from a seller, I was quoted £580, and complete in 2 to 3 months at latest, with the agreement of half up front and half on completion. Seemed fair to me. The seller raised an order immediately, which I paid. Come the shipping date, I was told to just sign off the order as it was a deposit and that was how deposits were done on Etsy. Well... now it is February 2021 and he's still not done. Thing is, the deposit is marked as completed, and there is still no 2nd listing for the completed project, so I am not sure what recourse of action I have.

\----

Details:

&gt;!The seller frequently delays. For example: he agreed to set up the listing Dec 23 2020. Then until Jan 19 2020 said he couldn't because a problem Etsy was having with tax arrangement and brexit meant that lots of British shop owners were having problems processing listings. Then said the problem has cleared on Jan 19 2021, and he'd put it up this week. Nothing. No replies until Feb 3 2021 because 'he forgot to turn notifications back on on his phone'. Then more silence. 2 days ago, he said he'll definitely set it up that day. Nope. Yesterday, he said he has written the listing he just needs to press 'activate' but didn't want to send it through at 11.30pm and disturb (I've mentioned before this would be no bother). Today, offered no excuse, but said he'll do it as soon as he's in front of a laptop in a bit. After 12 hours, still nothing. Then said 'You'll definitely get it in the next few hours, tonight'. And again, nope. And that is just for putting up the listing, which has now turned into a 29 day exercise. Many other things in the process have been like this. They do slowly get done, but incredibly stressfully.!&lt;

&gt;!I'm pretty sure I'm not being scammed, because I've seen many pictures of the commission. Many of these messages are over whatsapp because he replies astronomically slowly over etsy because 'notifications don't always work with etsy', so they're split across etsy and whatsapp.!&lt;

My thoughts so far are maybe a phone call, but i suspect it will be more false promises? I guess small claims court is an option, but I don't know the guys address, and after 17 months, I just want my product (which he assures me is on the brink of being finished).

Anybody know how I could drive this forward?

&amp;#x200B;

**EDIT: After a request to sort things out with a phone call, it was miraculously sorted within 5 minutes. Funny that. It was pretty bare bones, the listing only says '\[Name\]'s gun' but it seems to have set a dispatch date of 1-2 weeks which is what I wanted so... yay, some progress. Thank you all. And I paid it via PayPal / credit card this time. Just in case.** Seller keeps delaying a commission I've paid deposit on. How to proceed?"

I entered in the gross income from the 1099 (which is 2,000 higher than what Etsy shows on its own website?)

I already entered all my w-2s from our actual jobs as well... But it seems like having to pay more than a third of my actual income from my shop is too high?

SO my issue is I got this message saying there was a label adjustment to $3.91 which is fine the original postage was $3.49 and I figured they just didn't charge the correct amount with the rate increase. The problem is they charged me the $3.49 and now they charged my an additional $3.91.

Etsy,"I ordered a ring off Etsy a few weeks ago and haven’t received it yet.

Etsy,"I want to start off by saying that I have very very few sales. I had 2 sales last year. That said, I am filing for last year as a hobby and plan to do that myself. For this year, I am hoping to start treating my Etsy a little more like a real business, making an effort to do some marketing, consistently adding items, using social media, etc. With that, I don't think I really qualify as a hobby anymore at that point and was curious about what the next steps should be.

I have all the steps I need to take to be a business on a local level, but the tax things I'm highly unsure about. Can I still do the taxes myself, should I get a tax person now, or get a tax person towards the end of the year? Is there any expense tracking software that is recommended? Should I be doing this at all given that I literally had 2 sales so far?

EDIT: Also I work a full time job, so Im not sure how that impacts taxesDoes anyone sell very little and file taxes themselves?"

Etsy,"Back in September I was browsing logo designers on Etsy, and I came across a shop that I really liked. I purchased a logo, (keep in mind this is a digital product) and they were super nice about it. Weeks after weeks passed and i repeatedly asked kindly for update because they promised the logo would be done in a week and was in the description of the product. I never got any message back for months upon months. The only messages I got were saying that she is sorry and she is going to start. ???? I was so confused why she has not started and I was being really kind this whole time. Fast forward to FEBRUARY 15th, she finally messaged me back after I contacted her through her Instagram account and she said she was sorry and going to start working on it now. I already opened a case, but I do still want the logo. What should I do??? I want a refund + what I ordered because taking almost half a year on something that should’ve taken a week is absolutely ridiculous and is infuriating.

TLDR; Seller ghosted me multiple times on my logo, and after 5 months I still have not received it. What should I do? Already opened a case.Super frustrated with a custom order, what do I do?"

Etsy,"Hi everyone!

I am still quite new to Etsy and I need some advice on how to deal with lost mail. I am in no way saying that sellers are always right in this situation. 

I offer untracked mail for all my items and buyers have the option to upgrade to tracking at the checkout. This is the most cost efficient for both me and the buyers. I haven’t had a single buyer select tracked shipping. To be fair it’s very expensive in Canada.

I haven’t had any confirmed missing packages yet, but have seen other stores on Etsy and other platforms put a disclaimer that says they aren’t responsible for lost mail, damages, or delays. 

I would like to also put the same disclaimer because there is no way to track packages with no tracking and I can’t confirm whether a package is really missing or not. Stuff happens sometimes. I am however willing to replace orders if there’s tracking that shows a package is missing. I’m wondering if it’s enough to prove to Etsy in case I run into any problems in the future if I take pictures of all the receipt and packages with the stamp and addresses at the post office. This shows that I have done my job to send out the packages. 

I’ve heard Etsy automatically refunds customers if they say they haven’t received an item. Is this true? And how does Etsy process this? 

To those who have had experience in dealing with lost untracked packages, how do you go about it? Please let me know. I would like to hear different views on this. 

I hope I didn’t offend anybody. I haven’t taken any actions yet. Thanks :)Missing packages?"

But this shop owner contacted me regarding she felt that a few of my designs have been copied from her shop. We do not even have the same niche and my shop is older. I have many more sales and never even seen her shop on my feed. (Not being rude but that’s the truth) I wrote back respectfully and took down the listing that she was threatening to report me with because it’s just not worth it. I’m super frustrated. I don’t feel as if this is fair in any way. I have no intent on stealing anyone’s designs and spend so much time doing trend research I’m just mad about this. I am now thinking she may have seen my design style first and is trying to eliminate competition?

Etsy,"So someone purchased something from my shop. Now I have received a message from them:

ordered two silk pillow covers several months ago and waited a long time to receive.  i was unhappy as this mustard color was more to the brown side while the internet photo was brighter and had more orange to it. i also purchased a cover that you call bubblegum but the internet shows it as lavender.  neither color was what i wanted and do not match my decor.  at the time i was ill and hospitalized off and on.  when i returnered home i found a duplicate order which i certainly did not order.   someone in your office must have thoughy this was an unfilled order and sent a duplicate. i too have been a single woman raising two children. i know have $200 in pillow covers that i can't use either one.  you sent me a very kind note and i feel we are kindred spirits.  wishing you continued success and good health.  most sincerely...end of the message.

What does she mean? She doesn’t talk about returning them. Most of her claims about the color are non-factual. I don’t have anything like bubblegum color in the shop. I received a buyer note when she placed her second order and now she calls it duplicate. She spent total 200 (98+101.99=200 in two orders). She bought same thing twice. Is she having a remorse and telling me so many things? Orders were placed in dec and jan.

Edit update: guys, thank you for replying about this.  I checked my FB later today and I got a message from someone calling themselves her niece. They wanted to chat about the return process and that their aunt has dementia and she ended up ordering same thing twice. While this doesn’t solve mistry of the buyer’s note in second order where she openly asks for the whereabouts of the first order (it was a delayed delivery ).  know now that it is scammy but it has gone way too far now. I will have to accept return for at least one order because what if is really dementia affecting her memory 😞Help me out here please"

Etsy,"Hey guys, I have used Etsy to buy a few things here and there, but this is the first time where I've purchased something that has been inaccurately represented on the listing. I bought a vintage suit for several hundreds of dollars from a veteran seller, only to find that the trouser waist measurement is way off from what was said in the listing. I messaged the seller, politely described the issue, enclosed  photo evidence, and said that I'd like a refund of the full amount. 

When is an appropriate time to file a ""not as described"" case? I'm thinking I should eventually, as the seller's messages to me have just been accusatory (claiming I was just trying to hold the suit for Valentine's Day/I simply don't like the suit) and straight-up rude (saying this is my fault, I'm taking advantage of a small business, I wouldn't understand struggle because of my zip code ????), so I'm concerned that if I send the suit back, which I plan on doing anyway, I won't get the refund I deserve. Is it smart to open a case right before I ship the package or when the seller receives it?

Etsy,"Maybe this is old news but I am so annoyed by this that I have to write something and hopefully warn others.

I started selling on Etsy in 2020 and am now working on my taxes for 2020. I took up Etsy's offer to use Quickbooks Self-Employed, and have been happily (or so I thought) using it since August 2020. It dawned on me today, however, that there is no way to separate out the fees, shipping, or sales tax from the income deposits made in your accounts from the information QB SE is downloading directly from Etsy. Here is a sample from my books:

[https://drive.google.com/file/d/12y8IHyGiv1FquIdPLm2AAOLT90Z\_kP0d/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/12y8IHyGiv1FquIdPLm2AAOLT90Z_kP0d/view?usp=sharing)

I have one entry from Etsy that shows the actual sale, $162.09, and a second entry that will show what Etsy deposited into my business bank account for that week, which is $130.50.

But, neither of those numbers give actual revenue, because the $162.09 includes the price of the product, plus whatever the buyer has paid in shipping and sales tax, and the $130.50 is that $162.09 total minus advertising, transaction, shipping, etc fees from Etsy. So you cannot choose either of these numbers to generate the amounts you ultimately need to put on your Schedule C form for taxes. Basically your dreams of selecting transactions and coming up with a number that works for your gross income are dashed.

This brilliant human (and accountant)'s website explains this way better than I can, and I urge you to read it: [https://www.smallbusinesssarah.com/best-accounting-software-etsy-sellers/](https://www.smallbusinesssarah.com/best-accounting-software-etsy-sellers/)

I decided to heed her advice and switch over to GoDaddy from QB SE, but another hang up is that you can't download the CSV from QB SE and then pop it into GoDaddy, which only imports QFX files. So basically all of my due diligence on getting my books right in QB SE is for nothing.  I have to download all transactions again through GoDaddy, and then sift through everything again.

My only conclusion is that Etsy is getting some sort of kickback for selling QB SE to us, and it's gross. I saw an Etsy community post about this and a seller said they called QB directly and QB advised that QB SE is really meant for someone like an Uber driver, not an Etsy seller, specifically because of these issues.

Etsy could so easily fix this in their reporting, too. I don't get it.

PS. I'm not an accounting or finance major so if I've gotten some terminology wrong please let me know!

Curious to know everyone's thoughts and experiences.

UPDATE: Sorry if it looks like I abandoned this thread everyone; I live in Texas and we have had the week from hell down here. No power/heat for 85 hours for my house and it was sub freezing the whole time. Any fellow Texans out there I hope you have recovered and are staying safe &lt;3 Etsy pushing sellers to use QuickBooks Self Employed is SO WRONG"

I also found a column showing all my refunded orders in a yearly CSV so I added that in and it's still only about half of what they took out

shopify,"Hey [r/shopify](https://www.reddit.com/r/shopify/),

Dan here from EZ Order Tracking, a Shopify App that creates a mobile-friendly Order Tracking page on your store.

It's been 5 months since we started building the app and TODAY it is finally available to download on the official [Shopify App Store](https://apps.shopify.com/ezot?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=shopify&amp;utm_campaign=promo-launch).

We decided to build EZ Order Tracking because the current order tracking apps are old and outdated, but most importantly because they **cost a lot**.

You don't have to sell a kidney anymore just to get your very own tracking page, but don't confuse a low price point with less functionality.

# EZ is not just a name, with a few clicks you'll get

1. Get a mobile-optimized order tracking page in less than 60 seconds. **Just install the app, click enable and you are all set.**
2. Easily edit anything on the page. Is your store in French, German, Spanish, or maybe Japanese? **It doesn't matter.** You can edit every little piece of text on your tracking page so it will match with your store's language. But that's not all, you can change the colors as well. Everyone knows that branding is important, so we made it extremely easy to change the color scheme as well.
3. Automatically send emails to your customers when their order status is changing. You can either set the emails inside the app or just connect EZ Order Tracking with Klaviyo.
4. Cross-sell at just the right time. The order tracking page is not just a place for your customers to see where their shipment is at. With the cross-selling functionality, you can show your customers any product of your choice, which will help you get sale after sale.
5. Track orders shipped by 100+ carriers. If you work with a courier company that has more than 2 vans and 4 employees, EZ Order Tracking will work for you.

# We want to help small businesses grow

We ran a pre-launch exclusive right here a few months ago, so if you are one of the early adopters check your email for directions on how to redeem your special plan.

Of course, we wouldn't post in this community without another special promo: install EZOT in the next 30 days and secure the **free forever plan featuring:**

* all current features;
* all upcoming updates;
* track up to 30 orders per month;
* send up to 90 emails per month;

We will keep up the free forever plan until the 25th of March 2021 because of the high costs associated with order tracking. But if you secure yours now you can keep it forever and ever.

All you have to do is go to the [official EZOT listing page on the Shopify App Store](https://apps.shopify.com/ezot?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=shopify&amp;utm_campaign=promo-launch) and install the app. That's it!

# Start for FREE, pay just $4.97/month when you start to grow

**The Start plan - $4.97/month** \- allows you to track up to 80 orders per month and send up to 150 emails per month.

Problem:
I started paying for ads, in this case to Facebook and Google. The problem is that I'm spending money but not getting conversions. Facebook all ready gave me 2 customers although not enough to even cover the ads cost. In the Google case I'm spending money, getting some visits, but 0 conversions. I'm running both ads for over a week and questioning myself if I should continue to run them in -, cause the algorithm needs some time to find the perfect customer.

So I would love to hear some advice for that, what I can do to improve the ads and least make them cover the ads costs. If you will need more information feel free to let me know. I would really appreciate the help.

We’re interested in starting to sell some of our products on eBay. We currently have 1000+ items on our Shopify. I added the eBay integration to our Shopify account and have been experimenting with eBay listings to see how much control we have over eBay listings through the Shopify integration. The one thing I can’t seem to figure out is if there’s an easy way to bulk upload/edit some of the following eBay attributes through Shopify: Brand, Year, Features, Theme, Color, MPN, Recommended Age Range, etc.   


While we're on this topic, based on your experience with Shopify and eBay, would you recommend using Shopify to manage eBay with so many items (1000+)? or should we look into doing it directly through eBay? Any pros and cons you can share would be greatly appreciated

I've been trying to build a shopify website using the editor for my sister's business where she mainly does servivces like eyebrow waxing, bleaching etc and makeup and so on but will also be selling products soon hence why she wants to move to the Shopify platform.

One of the themes has a service list widget (not sure of the terminology?) that you can add to the page but when using other themes they don't seem to have this so I am wondering how exactly Shopify works then... It seems to me that if you want a particular feature on your website you need to choose a template that has that included and that there isn't a standard set provided by Shopify. Is this correct?

Or is Shopify really only meant to be for those selling products that can be shipped rather than for businesses that have clients that come in for services?

I know you can dive into the code but I thought the point of this was to be a more simple service for those without coding ability.

Is there any alternative?

shopify,"Hi all

I am trying to design a 5-6 page website hosted on shopify with some semi custom features. I usually just use a shopify template and am limited to what the template offers, but for this website I want some customization that I am sure will require a web designer.

The web designer I am working with currently from the Philippines (he works at my friends company and theyre helping me) has provided me 4 examples on photoshop and I am really not happy with any of them. It looks like a website from 2014-2015 and not one from 2021.

I need a website with custom images made (this is more graphic design based i guess) with 4 custom sections on the homepage like:

Header banner ---&gt; call to action (shop now) ---&gt; 3 clickable images with the 3 product categories ----&gt; 3 custom drawn emoticons showing the products benefit ----&gt; banner image showing more product benefits (no sugar, 0 calorie, etc) ----&gt; one more call to action on an image ----&gt; newsletter signup and then footer links.

Most of this is already possible on a simple free shopify template but I just need a little more customization.

**I also need a website that I can add or remove, or edit a product without having to hire a designer /coder each time (is this possible?)**

Im a bit lost now. Where do I go to hire someone who can actually do a modern website that isnt going to be thousands? are there apps or plugins I can use instead? or maybe even a website that I can select what I want and input code myself?

I'm hoping to get a bit of advice as I'm planning a new project.

I've used Shopify in the recent past for a wholesale store which I built, ran for a while and then sold, and the platform was really good for what we needed.

However, I'm starting a new project which is rather niche, and I'm not sure whether Shopify is the right platform, or whether there's something better I should be looking into.

We've got a database of 50,000,000+ products for sale, but of course I don't want to import all of those into an ecommerce platform (not sure if any of the platforms could handle that!) and I have a custom backend for searching through these products.

**TL;DR - Would it be possible to create a custom interactive UI on a Shopify store, to use our searching API to look through the products in our database, and then create a product on Shopify which the customer can buy?**

E.g. Customer searches our database, chooses the product they want, system creates a new product/order and the user goes to checkout as normal.Separate database with millions of products - is Shopify the right fit?"

shopify,"Hi everyone! I’m kinda new to shopify, I’ve only been using it for the past little over a week. I received an order over 4 days ago for $181. For the two items they purchased, they’re handmade items. I spent almost $70 on the materials needed to order it the day I sold it, and they’re already on there way to me (they’re also non refundable.) I also have in my store policies I don’t offer refunds because of this reason. Buyer emailed me this morning, four days later, saying she wants a refund of the $181. She claimed her daughter used her credit card without her permission. 
This is her exact words:

Good morning. I am emailing in regards to a order my daughter placed WITHOUT my permission. I recently discovered a charge of $181 was made onto my credit card recently. The order number is #1012. This order was done UNAUTHORIZED. I need to have the order cancelled immediately. If you are “unable” to cancel this order I will have to report the entire transaction as fraudulent. The email on the order is my daughters : (removed for privacy of course). Please respond back to me at your earliest convenience  

I’ve never had to deal with this before even though I’ve been a seller on a different platform for a few months. Can buyers really just claim the payment was unauthorized and get their money back, even if they might regret their purchase and are lying?
It concerns me because not only do I order in materials upon receiving an order but I also have dropshipped items. I’m afraid that I can have a dropshipped item on the way to the buyer already and it can’t be canceled / stopped in transit leaving me with a mess or buyer not returning the item. I’m losing $70 out of pocket now because she wants a refund. It may not sound like a lot to some, but I’m still a very small and new shopify business so it does hurt my business.

How do I go about these situations, especially this one right now?
Any help would be greatly appreciated

This is a multi layered conundrum involving Shopify, Facebook and Instagram. 

Backstory: a few months ago I was using Instagram shopping with no issues. We started the Instagram account with the original Shopify generated URL. Once we got our domain set up we did all the motions of changing it to that domain. 
This is what started all the issues as Instagram was no longer set up with that url. I did some research and got the Facebook account connected to the new domain. Now Instagram gives me the option to choose that url for shopping BUT I keep getting denied and given the error “products not available on your website”. I’ve had an open case with Facebook over this issue for 3 MONTHS 🥲 any help or clues would be appreciated! Thanks!

shopify,"Hello! This is a question for people who are Shopify developers, or at least knowledgeable about having Shopify pull a site's code from Github. I'm a coder by trade, so this will get technical :)

**Problem setup:** I have a local company that sells rugs. Let's pretend it's called Alabama Rug Company (alabamarugs.com). I want to also start New Jersey Rug Company (njrugs.com), Nevada Rug Company (nevadarugs.com), etc. The websites for each are nearly identical, just a bit of the text/images content is different. I'm trying to figure out the best way to be able to make a change to one ""master"" website, and have it propagate to all 3 company websites.

**My questions:**

1. Is it crazy to set up a deployment system that grabs the ""master website"" code, inserts every templated piece of content into it for a given rug company, and then pushes that rug company's version of the site to its own github repo? And Shopify is linked to that github repo separately for each site, ofc.
2. If I buy a template through the Shopify template marketplace, will I have to buy it separately for each site? Or can I just buy it once for the 3 sites, even though they're under separate Shopify accounts? I mean this in the sense of ""is this likely to be cool with Shopify"", not just ""will it  technically work""
3. Is doing this under separate Shopify accounts the best way to go?

shopify,"In February 11 orders over the course of 5 days were posted to our Shopify site which initially looked legitimate but turned out to be fraudulent. The orders were for items in our lower price range of offerings and did not attract notice until we received a charge back on the first order.

Normally a charge back can take months to show up but in this instance this one came only 6 days after the order was placed. We contacted the Bill To person who told us that her card info was hacked online, and she had canceled the card three days prior to our receiving the charge back from the bank.

Next we contacted the person on the receiving end who was at a different address and they had indeed ordered the item. 

But not from us, from Ebay!!!

Yikes!!!

The scammer had setup several of our products on Ebay at the lowest price on the internet and had even used our site to compare the price!!! They then get an order from the buyer using Paypal (which cleared in 3 days even though Ebay claims they wait for buyer confirmation) and then move the money out of their account. They then order from our Shopify site using the stolen card info, and the buyers delivery address. 

We handle hundreds of orders per week and had been capturing the transaction at time of order, instead of auth/capture (which we switched too immediately). We then started looking closely at every order and that's when we discovered 10 other suspicious orders, which did turn out to be fraudulent. We returned the money and canceled the orders but not before shipping pushed four of them out the door.

The scammer made a few bucks, we lost a few bucks, but we learned a very valuable lesson.

1. Use AUTH/CAPTURE mode so that you don't lose anything if you find fraud.

2. Check every order closely where the Bill To / Ship To are not the same.

3. Call the bill to address and confirm a legitimate charge, then call the recipient and confirm they ordered from your store.

4. Scan Ebay once a week for your product descriptions and make sure the seller isn't scamming your products for card fraud.

shopify,"Hi. I need to build a custom hair care website on Shopify. Here I will have a hair care quiz on the landing page. The quiz will contain 5-10 questions asking about the user's hair characteristics, hair goals and then land them on the result page where I recommend shampoo, conditioner and a few combos. When the user adds any or all of these products, I want the quiz answers to be attached to the product in the cart.

shopify,"*This is one part of multiple articles I’ll be writing about a system for creating a successful Shopify stores. If you want to follow along, you can* [sign up here](https://shopify.dabido.com.au/pdfs) *to be notified about future articles, and also to get a free illustrated PDF file of this post with another guide.*

I made four Shopify stores - the first three were failures, and the last one succeeded. Over time, I used each store as a way to learn more about what works and what doesn’t. My current main Shopify store pockets me a nice $1000 AUD/fortnight profit (equivalent to about $800 USD) and I now spend one hour a month on it, but to be honest it probably took a few months of dedicated work to get to that point.

In this part of a series of articles I’ll write, I want to give you my full method for finding product market fit — in other words, a way to **figure out which products actually sell before you start to spend a whole heap of money on ads**.

Ads are expensive and risky if you’re not sure what you’re doing, and I’ve spent literally tens of thousands of dollars on Facebook ads/Google ads/digital agencies before — but that was really dumb, because I didn’t even know what would work before I threw money at advertising. I’d like for people to avoid my mistakes, here creating the guide I would have wanted when I started.

The first step that worked for me is to **find product market fit before spending money**. Unlike the other Shopify stores where I spent money on ads and hoped for the best, I tested the products for this store *before* starting a store. This is how you can do it too.

# Understanding funnels briefly

A brief important concept to understand is that the value of a customer is directly proportional to the amount of *intent* that they have when visiting your store.

In a very brief and simplified explanation: your *top of funnel (TOFU)* is your least profitable audience, being composed of strangers that find out about your store for the first time. These are people that have never heard of you. But, hopefully, they need what you’re selling.

After they visit your store page, they become *bottom of funnel*. These people - who will do things like add to cart - are your most profitable audience, and showing them ads to your store eventually gives you the most bang for your buck. You can generally expect that spending $1 on ads here will give you about $2-3 back conservatively.

# Why starting with ads can be wrong

A lot of Shopify gurus recommend starting with Facebook ads. I actively disagree. Facebook Ads is one of the things that requires the most active thought into creation, interpretation, and risk to your wallet. Therefore, a lot of people are led astray into believing this is the answer.

Facebook ads *can* be amazing. Their machine learning can pick out really good customers for you. But I wouldn’t start there. Before taking a step into ads, **a much safer way is to test product-market fit for free first.** In other words, to figure out if people actually will buy your product *before* you spend money on ads.

# A few shortcuts to thinking about winning products

* What products have you bought in the past?
* What products have you actually found use for?
* What products have a high perceived value but low actual cost? Generally speaking if this cost is $10, then the price I’m selling for has to be at least $30 — in other words, 3x the price. I’ve sold products before that cost me $100 but sold for $220, so therefore a profit margin of $120. The key is to have **enough margin so that when you eventually do spend money on ads, you have a “buffer” that you can spend on freelancers for automation and - finally - actually make a profit in the end.**

# Achieving product-market fit for free

Facebook Marketplace is a part of the Facebook app where you can buy and sell goods, kind of like eBay but much easier. It’s only unlocked if you’ve had Facebook for a while, and is accessible via the Marketplace icon. It’s really easy to sell things on there.

What we’re going to do is **sell a product on there that you want to eventually sell on your Shopify website**. Now, it’s great if you can get some sales from there, but the real purpose is to see how many people people message you about your product - because chances are, if people *really* want your product here, then you’ll have a much better time with that product when you eventually spend the effort to put it on a Shopify store.

Here’s how you tell if you are successful: people will contact you directly on Facebook messenger to ask about your product.

&gt;If you get more than 9 people asking you for your product in 24 hours, that’s success. For me this has correlated with a roughly 2-3% conversion rate on my website for people that will **buy** that particular product.

It was actually ridiculous when it happened and I knew I was onto something. I got about 20+ conversations from people interested in buying my product over two days.

Because I was pretty excited and wanted to share this, I told this to a friend and **he got 40+ conversations of people asking for a different product in two days.**

This is how you I know I achieved something that looks like **product-market fit**. This method is actually amazing, because it essentially means:

* You can test as many products as you want, for free
* You can experiment with product, pricing, descriptions, and pictures - so if it doesn’t sell, it is **only** because of one of those four things - and NOT your website
* You find out within 1 or 2 days whether your product will sell. No conversations? Then people won’t buy it no matter how many tricks you throw in your website

In fact, I actually met up with someone who bought the product in person from me. So it was complete game changer.

# Why this is so powerful

**The best part of this is that if your product** ***doesn’t*** **sell well on your Shopify store, then it’s because it’s not the product but that you can isolate the problem to** ***the traffic or the store page*****.** And there are ways that you can systematically eliminate the issues till it turns into a product page that does actually sell.

# What if I don't use Facebook? 

Trying your product on various free marketplaces like eBay or even Craigslist is another way to do it. The fundamental principle is the same: test it in places where you can get free traffic, and see if it sells. It looks like harder work at the start, but it'll really save you a headache later on. 

# Conclusion

Now that you have this [method of testing products that you can do for free](https://shopify.dabido.com.au/pdfs), finding products that will sell well becomes risk-free. I wish I did this before launching expensive stores that didn’t work. I even made the mistake of starting a fifth store without this method, and it bombed badly. So don’t do that. Achieve a mini-success that you can snowball into a significantly greater likelihood of being profitable.How to find winning products WITHOUT spending money: a guide"
shopify,"Hi Everyone,

I'm currently scaling my Facebook Ads with a single creative - testing different audiences. Anyways, that Facebook Ad Creative is getting a lot of great engagement with questions from prospects, positive feedback about the video, and then hate...

A lot of ""hate"" comments range from ""you guys are a scam"" or ""don't buy stuff from Facebook bc I've scammed etc"" or straight-up people ""your product is garbage"" (All of which are NOT previous customers).

My business is not the traditional shopify model because I own a boutique with the products I sell online. My boutique has been open for 12 years in California. (Joined e-commerce late in Feb 2020)

Some of the comments are a bit disheartening when none of what they say is true. Again, none of the people are previous customers, any hiccups I've had with customers I promptly fixed email or phone calls.

My question is how do you guys respond to hate comments? Or if you were in my position how would you respond to stuff like this?

Is it an opportunity for PR? Or is it better to hide all the ""hate/scam/garbage"" comments so people who are looking at my comments at a quick glance don't actually think I'm scamming people?

shopify,"Hi everyone. I started running a site since end of 2019. It is a small shop with less than 40 items, and average selling price is about $40-50. 

Have to admit that it is growing very slowly. After one year currently every month I receive about 20-25 orders (so roughly $1000). This is based on about 80-120 sessions per day. However I do want to scale it up as fast as possible since I have more time now.

I have been running google shopping which has been okay. However it is impossible for me to scale up shopping traffic very fast. (Is it true that I can only increase the total amount of items to increase shopping traffic? Because I have almost reached the higher bidding price I can afford to keep a reasonable profit.

I have also tried FB ads but ROI is much lower than google. So I stopped it and did not get a chance to scale up.

I'm just not sure is there any other strategy I should think about to increase the traffic while I will still keep profitable? The conversion (although maybe not very high) is there - but what can I do to increase the total visitors? Shall I focus on adding more items (it takes much time as every item was created manually) if both organic and paid source have been tried?

we are the founders of a fashion label. We have decided to sell our entire label for 1200€ because our interest is no longer in fashion and have new ideas that we want to pursue. 

Everything is there and everything is already implemented, the only thing that needs to be planned is production and advertising. Since we have no more interest in it, we would find it a pity if the brand now simply degenerates and bogs down. So we would be happy if someone else would continue it, whose passion is big enough for the industry. 

We still have about 30 shirts ready for sale in stock, labels, stickers, hangtags, size labels, and packaging as well. Our domain and mailbox are still valid for half a year. We have all the print designs, promotional images that have not been released yet, and a completely finished website. Our Instagram account has 11k followers of which about 2.5% are real. We have had several influencer collaborations that had an average of 40K followers. We still have a fully equipped screen printing machine. Our website gets about 250 organic views a month and has top SEO placement. Of course, we will send you all the credentials, files, accounts, etc. with us and work you in for 2-3 weeks if you decide to buy. However, it should actually be faster. 

So if someone is interested in a small and as good as ready label and has enough interest for the brand, then get in touch. We would be very happy to tell you more about everything.

Kind regards:)

I'm seeking some advice on how to handle a situation.

Upon receiving the returned item, we found a significant tear in the jacket she ordered. 

The customer denies having caused the damage herself and did not report it when processing her return (as we state in our refund policy on the site). She's still demanding a refund, but I'm not willing to honor it due to receiving it in poor condition (I did offer to ship it back).

shopify,"Hello all,

I have been googling and testing for the last couple of days and cannot figure this out for the life of me. 

I have multiple products that have a single category of variants, but there are about 35 available variants per listing (all within the same category of variants). 

I would like my listings to have a small text box that automatically shows the current available quantities for each variant (e.g. When Size 38 is selected, it has text that shows under the title that says “We have 5 units in stock for this size, etc.).

I also posted this on the Shopify forums but got no answers.

I have tried two different solutions from those forums that showed up on Google but neither of them worked for one reason or another. They both required the page to be refreshed before updating the quantity. I am wanting the text to automatically update every time I select a new variant.  

I am using the Debut theme. Any and all help is greatly appreciated.

Here are the solutions I've tried:

shopify,"Had the pleasure of /u/dandemsky joining me on [Pitstop](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/lucas-walkers-pitstop/id1539922392). Dan is the cofounder of Unbound Merino and up until this time last year, they mostly served travelers like me who don't enjoy packing a lot of luggage.

Dan joined to talk about working with suppliers, pivoting, and still creating urgency without relying on discounts exclusively. 

##Episode 1 - Retention Marketing - Listen on [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/episode/41NLGRauESRQDakjr6PFIb?si=eEP6X4osQ42efpxJEblOoA) / [Apple](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/lucas-walkers-pitstop/id1539922392)


* **Know what your business is**, not your sales pitch. ""comfortable travel"" may be out, but Unbound Merino's products are still high quality, and supply has not been disrupted, so the only thing that needed change was the message the customer received
* **Trust and rely on the customers who got you where you are.** They haven't gone away, the consumer information you gathered from them is still valid, so tailor your efforts towards making their relationship with your brand even stronger, and they will continue to support you, financially with sales and dynamically with feedback
* **Recognize that you're not the only company facing difficulties**, and capitalize on the disruption to others. Suppliers may now find themselves with inventory that otherwise would be sold to a competitor, but you may be able to pick up at a discount. See where you can expand your business, purely based on unanticipated availability and sudden absences in the market
* **Embrace the excitement of scarcity.** While a reliable stock is your backbone, unexpected inventory can allow you to surprise your customers with limited special offers and exclusive products. With everyone stuck at home, craving some excitement, even an unexpected, ""while quantities last"" t-shirt can become an event that gets your consumer base talking, and buying
* **Don't abuse your customer's trust with panic-messaging.** If you have a normal pace for seasonal sales, don't disrupt that, you customers look forward to them and rely on them for solid deals. Sending them a barrage of messages about sudden, unannounced sales only weakens that relationship, annoys your customer, and makes your company seem unsure and unstable. Keep a steady hand on the promotional wheel.


## Episode 2 - Creating Urgency - Listen on [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4c4psYkyYXJPbCmanI3MXT?si=RLULUHXzSoOMLSGMUcPfrA) / [Apple](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/lucas-walkers-pitstop/id1539922392)

* **Be open, clear and honest with your customers** about new, unexpected stock as well as retiring stock. A new item is exciting, but many customers become comfortable and reliant on mainstays, and if given fair warning that an item may soon disappear, will rush to grab as many as they can
* **If the item is a limited time offer, make it very clear to the consumer how many are left**, and how much time is left on the clock for them to make a decision. Often the very idea that someone else may have something special or unique is enough to drive others to desire it
* **Let your customers in on the trade secrets and internal knowledge** of your product line for any limited time offers, such as where the mystery item came from or why you're phasing a product out. Allowing your customers to share a sense of identity and pride in your flash sale will lead to them promoting you, free of charge
* **Trust that customers** who took advantage of one special buy-now-before-its-too-late event will eagerly hang around and wait for the next, confident that they have some secret knowledge of how to score the really good deals from their favourite brand

In the next episode, Dan shares how they approached SEO, and why they were willing to wait two years to see the full results.

does anyone have a solution for fixing the quantity order abuse?

Customers can change the quantity in the cart to 99999, and it will automatically update and change the quantity to the amount that is in your inventory. I've tried to fix this bug by changing some code, but it doesn't work.

HTML I've added into the quantity input field:

min=""0"" max=""5"" maxlength='1'  pattern=""\[0-5\]\*""

shopify,"Hi r/shopify

I run a project at [shopboreal.com](https://shopboreal.com) which is a search engine to find products from hundreds of thousands of independent merchants. My goal is to help merchants get found.

I've been prototyping with a new product I'd like to get people's feedback on. It's called Boreal Community ([shopboreal.com/community](https://shopboreal.com/community)). Bounce rates on stores tend to be quite high, often because visitors don't find what they're looking for (e.g. they search a product and the store doesn't sell it). Instead of having them go back to Google and keep searching, why not partner up with other merchants to direct the visitor to a partner store who does sell the item. In the process making a commission. The landing page has more info and a wireframe of the designs. [shopboreal.com/community](https://shopboreal.com/community)

shopify,"I posted this before on another sub, but I’d also like to share this here. A little background about me, I’m the marketing manager of a then-startup company turned into a now-growing company. We tried several tools to market our services and some are really just a waste of time and money. It was a long ride, but we finally found the five perfect tools for every marketing savvy out there. 

* [Smartlook](https://www.smartlook.com/)

If you’re offering services or products like us, Smartlook is a must-have. What it does is it records what the users are clicking and checking out on your website. Smartlook saved our UX designer a lot of times, since he already knows where potential customers encounter problems or has a hard time navigating through by watching the records. 

Aside from that, Smartlook can also track and record a mobile app if you have one. I’m not that familiar with the process so I really can’t elaborate. They have pro plans which are really worth it imo. It gives us an idea where to improve and understand our clients better.

* [HubSpot](https://www.hubspot.com/)

I think almost everyone knows what HubSpot is, but it’s actually the best CRM tool out there. We can easily see the customers who need immediate help and those who we haven’t followed up by creating tickets. Emails are perfectly laid out, we can see if the client has opened the email, how long it has been since we kept in touch, etc. HubSpot also offers a lot of online courses for free through HubSpot academy, which means you can also help your employees learn a new skill. Hitting two birds with one stone, yes? 

Did I mention that this is free? Oh, yeah. It’s free. Add-ons? Optional.

* [Canva](https://www.canva.com/)

We have a UX designer on our team but we don’t expect them to do a graphic designer’s job. So for our graphic design needs, we use Canva. Canva’s really helpful in making simple graphic banners to supplement your blogs and newsletters because of their wide-selection of templates. Frankly, we can’t afford an Adobe subscription, and it will take us a looong time to learn the software. Canva’s absolutely free, except if you want to go pro. Sweet.

* [Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com/)

Why is this one here, you ask? As much as possible, we want to look credible and precise to our potential clients. Several grammatical errors can make our site look unprofessional and “scammy,” especially when writing marketing copies. I mean, you don’t want your clients to read “I want to eat dad!” instead of “I want to eat, dad!” right? Bad example, but I know you get it! This one’s also free, but I suggest getting the Premium. You can set the tone there, the style you want to use (like professional, casual, business), and receive better suggestions. Price starts from $12.50/member (3 to 9 members).

* [Airtable](https://airtable.com/)

Airtable is a database platform which your team can edit and update. They have “bases” where you can add specific members of your team and help them focus on a certain project. It’s really hard to explain how this one works, but you can do whatever you want in it. You can even automate some actions and integrate apps.

It’s also free, unless you want to go for a pro plan.

Honorable mentions:

Asana - for creating your team’s tasks

Buffer - for social media management

Unsolicited advice: Don’t be afraid to try out tools, even if it means wasting a bit of money. There will be lots of trial and errors in this journey, but you have to go through the process of finding out the best tools you can use for the job. These tools are here to make everything easier and less heavy, so they’re really worth the investment. Cheers!The best 5 marketing tools that worked for our Shopify store"

Basically, my boss set up an accordion / FAQ layout app on our Shopify backend for our FAQs page. Creates collapsible blue question bars that open up onto answers - you know the drill. Looks better than what we had before and it also allows you to embed certain categories on other pages on the website besides the FAQ page. The app's called ""Easy FAQ"". Fantastic.

Here's the problem: I need the four blue collapsible menu items to collapse into the category (""Golf Carts""). So before each embedded section, I've put an H2 with that section's title - I want to make that H2 clickable and have it expand onto all of the blue collapsible menu items created by the app. There's no native way to do this with Easy FAQ, I've already spoken to support and they've written that off as impossible. My boss, however, is committed to using the app so I'm stuck working on this problem now.

shopify,"*This is one part of multiple articles I’ll be writing about a system for creating a successful Shopify stores. If you want to follow along, you can* [*sign up here to be notified about future articles*](https://shopify.dabido.com.au)*.*

I made four Shopify stores - the first three were failures, and the last one succeeded. Over time, I used each store as a way to learn more about what works and what doesn’t. My current main Shopify store - that I made in 2018 - pockets me a nice $1000 AUD/fortnight profit now (equivalent to about $800 USD) and I now spend one hour a month on it, but to be honest it probably took at least a few months of dedicated work to get to that point even on that one store.

I’ll be writing a series of interconnected articles about the things I learnt along the way, because I figured out my own way of doing it in a way that reduces risk of losing money as much as possible, and gives you feedback along the way so that you can eventually make a profitable store by yourself.

There’s a lot of “if you do this you will make $100,000 online in no time” stuff on the internet, but I think this often leads people to a rather dangerous path of spending thousands of dollars on e.g. Facebook Ads and then losing it. Please learn from my own mistakes! There’s a lot of moves that you can make that are lower risk and more likely to succeed than others, so I’ll list my own opinionated version of them here.

1. **Find product-market fit first without ads.** Ads are expensive and risky. Gurus make it sound straightforward, but ads are honestly really difficult *and you don’t have to use ads at the beginning*. I personally use Facebook Marketplace to pre-test my products.
2. **Create trust signals to make it safe for customers to purchase.** At the bare minimum, you need:
   1. An About Us page
   2. A Returns Policy
   3. A Shipping page
   4. Ideally, a chatbox to increase trust for your customers / provide support
   5. A positive reviews box
3. **A high converting Shopify page.** The key here is to make sure syou’re addressing customer’s intent in as concise a way as possible. To be perfectly honest, the text matters a bit and should obviously be well written in order to confer trust, but **it’s the pictures that will move someone to buy your product**. I’ve analysed the traffic on my website, and whilst barely anyone scrolls much text beyond the first paragraph or two, *almost everyone* that actually purchases will look at at least three pictures of your product.
4. **Use higher intent traffic.** I personally find Facebook ads is one of the hardest, requiring a lot of data (i.e. money spent) before you can nail down whether something will really work or not. So in my case, I use Google ads.
5. **Capture much more value by retargeting.** I use a combination of Facebook ad retargeting, Google ad retargeting, email marketing, and SMS marketing also little tweaks that make my store much more profitable and do so in a way that’s really automated. This increases the lifetime value of your customer (LTV) by a huge amount, and is necessary in order to make your top of funnel ads more profitable. Unlike trying to use cold Facebook ads at top of funnel and testing them out with heaps of ad sets/campaigns, retargeting generally is much more likely to be profitable — and if even retargeting is not profitable, then there’s probably a very low chance that sending Facebook ads to even colder audiences is going to be profitable.
6. **Automate your product fulfilment**. Fundamentally you want to automate the delivery of your products so you spend *the least amount of time here possible*. Having to pack products for hours doesn’t make you a business, it makes you a self-employee — maybe a worthwhile step at the start whilst you’re trying to learn the ins and outs of fulfilment, but you really want to be spending time growing your business instead of just working within it. Which leads to the next point…
7. **Automate your customer service too.** The key way to do this is to create systems for a freelancer to do it without your oversight. Again, answering customer enquiries for hours takes you away from the things that actually grow the business. You can do this at the start, but I would try to automate this as soon as you’ve got a bit of cash.

# The traffic flow

If your Shopify store is a living creature, then traffic is the blood which keeps it alive and growing. Turning traffic into customers requires a little understanding of the stages that people *must* go through before they actually purchase from you. A stranger to your website is considered *top of funnel (TOFU)*. Someone who’s clicked the add to cart or checkout buttons can be considered *bottom of funnel (BOFU)*. The BOFU audience is always more profitable than the TOFU audience, but without any TOFU you don’t have BOFU at all.

**Unaware** – no idea of problem or your product.

**Problem aware** – knows they have a problem that they want solved, but don't know what is used to solve it.

**Solution aware** – knows there is a solution, but don't know a specific product to solve it.

**Product aware** – knows about your product.

**Most aware** – someone who just needs a little push to buy your product. These audiences are really profitable.

## What this actually looks like

I use Google Ads as my TOFU. This high intent traffic has been really profitable for me. To achieve last year’s revenue of $69,000, I spent $20,300 on Google Ads to achieve that. This $20,300 also includes a significant amount of BOFU traffic mixed inside.

I use a combination of Google Ads, Facebook Ads, and Email as my BOFU.

* Google Ads: mixed in with the $20,300 above.
* Facebook Ads: I spent about $586 to get $2,338 of that revenue. It makes a really small portion of my advertising, but for me it’s equivalent to $3.98 for every $1 I spend on it.
* Email: I spent $360 on emails via Klaviyo. My email remarketing campaigns made me $3,158 of that revenue. This is equivalent to getting back $8.77 for every $1 I spend. I do much more here than people typically do.

There is an additional extreme benefit to email. **If you take away nothing from this article, you need to build an email list.** This is literally how you grow the value of your website over time. Every other piece of traffic is rented traffic; you can never make money from a fleeting customer from Facebook or Google again, unless you have a way to re-contact them. So by **collecting people’s emails, your website will actually grow more valuable over time,** and this protects against the random fluctuations that naturally occur with ads where sometimes you can just have a bad month.

There are, of course, other avenues that people love. SEO is a good one but takes a long time to see results, generally. There’s enough case studies on Instagram, and that’s probably been made easier with the recent addition of Instagram Shop inside the platform itself, but I haven’t tried it yet. And some others find TikTok useful too since growth is relatively quick, but again this is something I’m not too familiar with honestly.

## Automation

I hire from UpWork. I’ll talk about this in more depth as hiring deserves its own article, but the fundamental principles that have helped me are:

* **Cheaper is not necessarily better.** It can be tempting to hire virtual assistants that are $8/hr from overseas, but this can often dilate in terms of time anyway and a job that would take 1 hours with a $24/hr assistant takes 3 hours with a $8/hr assistant. Gaming the system from a freelancer perspective is unfortunately quite common especially at these really low rates.
* **A rigorous vetting process helps sort out those who are serious to those who are not.** Depending on what you’re hiring for, the best way to try to differentiate those who can actually do something vs those who can’t, is to ask a technical question that can only be answered if they know the particular software and can’t really Google the answer. As a real basic example, you might give a question like “in Excel, if I wanted to get the total value of all the costs added together from cells B2 to F2, what is the equation I would need to do that?” Doesn’t matter for this so much but matters more when you’re hiring for something more technical e.g. hiring for graphic design (“what’s the technical term when you apply two layers on top of another - for example, a vector circle in layer 2 and a .png image in layer one - and then make it so that only the image underneath the circle is shown?”) or coding (“if I wanted to use Python to automate a macro to click HTML elements, which package are you intending on using?”).
* **Sometimes you just need to try quickly, and fire quickly.** 90% of people you work with will be decent and honest. 10% will scam. One of the unfortunate things I came across was an Upwork freelancer who pretended to do work and clocked up hours, but then I realised that the files she was supposedly working on had nothing inside them!
* **Be a good boss.** No-one likes to work for bad people. Good employees will stick around for good people.

# Conclusion

I’ll be talking about each individual part here in more depth, because each individual part is a post of its own. You can [sign up here to be notified about future Reddit posts](https://shopify.dabido.com.au) if you found this valuable and want to follow along, as I’ll be going into more depth about all of these. I want to try and make a bunch of articles that are basically as useful as possible for anyone running their own eCommerce stores.

Honestly, $69,000 AUD (equivalent to about $52K USD) is not a huge amount, and there are Shopify owners who are far more successful. Nonetheless, whether you’re a beginner or an eCommerce veteran, I hope that something I’ve learnt in my own journey might be of use to you.

Feel free to let me know if there's anything in particular you'd like to add or that you want me to talk about. I'm sure lots of people here would have experiences for their own stores which would also be really valuable, who may have done things completely differently.

I'm probably gonna close soon, and I want critical feedback for the next time.

I might close it soon because my dog needs a surgery and I won't be able to pay for facebook ads for it the next 2 months (more or less).
But if some of you think it has potential, maybe I'll leave it open until I get more money for ads.
To be honest, I'm hesitant about its potential, after $100 put on fb ads I got 1 sale, net loss of $76, I think is because mugs are hard to sell.

Are there any themes you guys would recommend for someone like me who has no expertise, and no money to hire anybody with expertise.

Is there any advantage to going with a Shopify premium theme vs something on themeforest? I'm not quite sure what the deal with updates is, but as far as I'm aware, Shopify themes will auto update and I'd have to update a 3rd party theme myself, correct?

shopify,"They find your Shopify shop (Great!)  
They find a product they like (Great!)  
They go to checkout (Great!)  
... but they don't end up buying the product.

Even with the best marketing it's hard to get those shoppers out the door with a sale. There are several reasons that they don't complete the buy. But there is one way to prevent it.

When you go to a store and you're at a checkout, what information do you provide? Just some cash or a card depending on how you're paying. They may ask you if you have or would like to join a rewards program for an extra discount, and you may take it or say no and continue about your day.

You may have noticed it by now but there's one thing that you may be doing backwards. 

Setting up an account for your shop.

A lot of shops still do this. Making their shoppers go through a whole account sign up process in order to buy what they really wanted, but by the time they see what they have to fill out, they lose interest.

Sounds like it shouldn't be a problem but any inconvenience can turn that potential shopper into a walker. So what's the alternative?

Here are two options: Guest Checkout and/or Open Authentication

**Guest Checkout** is pretty clear. As a shopper they have the ability to bypass creating an account and dive in straight to their information for their purchase.

**Open Authentication** is an easier way to get customers turned into members. Shoppers head to the checkout and are prompted with the ability to sign in using things that they are already logged into like Facebook, Gmail, or Twitter for example. This makes the registration process seamless and can even help with a faster checkout. 

There are plenty of Shopify apps that have the open authentication ability if that's what you're looking for. Overall, make it easier for your shoppers to complete their purchases and your sales will thank you!Get More Carts Out The Door"

shopify,"Hi everyone, we published a new guide on our website - [https://www.customervox.com/ecommerce-blog/7-critical-elements-to-make-effective-popups-for-seasonal-or-promotional-sales](https://www.customervox.com/ecommerce-blog/7-critical-elements-to-make-effective-popups-for-seasonal-or-promotional-sales)

As you know popups have a bad reputation, but they are effective and widely used in ecommerce. Would love to hear your feedback and your experience with popups. 

As you know popups have a bad reputation. They interrupt navigation and disrupt the customer journey. But the truth is that a well-designed popup can be the virtual equivalent of a blockbuster sale: Top performing popups enjoy a conversion rate of 3.1%, making them more effective than display ad marketing campaigns and many other forms of promotion. Popups also have the advantage that, beyond the initial cost, you can run them free of charge. 

The trick is that there is a right way and a wrong way to go about popups. This is especially true with regard to seasonal offers or other promotional sales. Done right, sales and discount popups inform visitors that you are running a sale and that they can buy products on your website for less. Mostly, sales popups are used as an entry or a timed popup, in order to facilitate a visitor’s interaction with the site.

To get more customers and increase sales and revenue, you have a lot of options: email promotion, search or display ads, posts on social networks, affiliate or referral partners—the list goes on. However, when it comes to promoting a sale, popups are often your best bet. It’s no coincidence sales popups are among some of the most popular and effective popups.

**Sales campaigns**

Most ecommerce websites run different sales campaigns during the year, especially throughout the holidays. We have all encountered campaigns for Black Friday, Cyber Monday, Thanksgiving, and Christmas sales. When seasonal sales begin, most ecommerce sites offer significant discounts and run popup campaigns to advertise them.

A typical sales campaign may include discounts, free samples, or bonuses like free shipping targeted for a particular season. These campaigns are a great opportunity to offer products and deals that make sense in the context of a certain holiday.

For example, around Mother’s Day, many shoppers will want to buy women’s clothes, flowers, or cosmetics. Based on the demographics of your customers, see which products from your store would make the most relevant gifts for Mother’s Day. Then offer a sale on those products.

Case in point: West Elm uses this popup to promote their Mother’s Day sale, inviting visitors to buy their mother a present crafted by popular mom bloggers. 

Unique, relevant, and clear, this offer is likely to wow visitors and convince them to purchase a one-of-a-kind gift for their own moms. But it doesn’t just happen magically! In fact, this popup is carefully composed and calculated to convert customers.

**Effective popups**

To be effective, popups need to follow certain principles. Otherwise, customers will not absorb the information and actually make a purchase.

Here are seven critical elements that go into every effective popup:

\- Clarity

\- Control

\- Creativity

\- Relevance

\- Charm

\- Value

\- Respect

Combined, these qualities make the difference between a successful popup and an unsuccessful popup. At best, a popup will convert a visitor into a customer. At worst, a popup will cause a visitor to close their browser window and leave your store. With only a split second to win over the customer, there’s very little margin for error, so let’s explore each of these essential principles in detail.

**Clarity**

Clarity means that the information you are trying to convey to your visitor is clear and unambiguous. If your customer cannot understand the information, they will be unlikely to convert or click on your call to action.

Informing customers of a discount or sale may seem pretty straightforward. But keep in mind you have to convey not only what you offer, but also how the sale applies to them. 

It’s important to offer full information and not omit any details. For instance, if you leave out a crucial detail about how some shoppers are not eligible for your offer, you are going to undermine the trust of some customers.

Hyphen provides a good example of using very clear language to promote an offer. The copy explains to visitors that they will receive $100 off each product they buy, provides a code, and mentions when the deal ends.

In addition, there is an element of urgency in the form of a countdown timer. The call to action is also clear and prominent in the popup. 

**Control**

When a customer navigates to your website, they want to be in full control of the experience. In fact, the main advantage of a website is that visitors can peruse it at their leisure.

By using a popup, in a way, you take the control away from your visitor. You attempt to point them in the direction you want them to take. This is the danger of popups, and it’s the main reason why people are repelled by poorly-designed ones. 

In order to avoid this problem, you need to enable your visitors to opt-out of your popup easily. If visitors can’t reclaim control quickly and easily, they will not be able to continue their customer experience and will most likely close their browser window, leaving your website.

Furniture retailer Apt2B uses their popup not only for sales but also to generate leads. Their call to action button invites visitors to leave their email addresses in order to receive future promotional emails. The main point of the popup, however, is to inform visitors of the 4th of July sale.

The common “x” button at the right-hand corner of the popup allows customers to maintain control over their experience. The copy, in the patriotic spirit of the holiday, offers furniture made in the USA.

**Creativity**

This principle is one of the hardest to nail down. To woo your visitors, you need to present them with compelling imagery and wording that will grab their attention. Customers who are delighted by a popup are much more likely to click on the call to action.

Include humorous copy or unexpected pieces of information to entice visitors to read the info all the way through rather than opt out.

United by Blue uses a popup for Black Friday. The copy is unusual, as it invites customers to help celebrate Blue Friday, providing an unexpected twist with the wording. True to the spirit of the brand, they use “Get Involved” as their call to action, since United by Blue promotes a sustainable and environmentally friendly lifestyle.

**Relevance**

Crucially, the popup must be relevant to the customer. It needs to convey appropriate information and should also connect with the page the customer is visiting. If the popup doesn’t align with the content, the visitor will likely close it and proceed to the information they intended to find.

Your popup also needs to align with your brand. The content of a popup should provide the same visual identity, brand voice, and language that your customers are familiar with and will expect from your business. A relevant deal that’s on brand makes the chances higher that customers will actually convert.

**Halloween popup**

This highly relevant popup uses a pumpkin with a clock to indicate that time is running out for customers to take the deal. The copy clearly provides an incentive to seize the one-of-a-kind offer.

**Charm**

The charm of a popup is closely connected to its creativity. If the copy is creative, the charm part will take care of itself. Sufficiently charmed visitors may even share links to your website in order to show your interesting popup to their friends.

The charm of a popup is hard to quantify, but the best indicator is its conversion rate.

This Christmas promotion from Applecrumby &amp; Fish uses an image of a baby in a Santa Claus suit to promote baby toys. Both relevant and cute, it’s likely to grab the attention of visitors and get leads, thanks to its high charm quotient.

**Value**

Like every other call to action or conversion process on your website, a popup needs to give something of value to your visitor in order for any of them to convert. For sales popups, the promise of value is very clear: an opportunity to purchase a product at a lower price than usual.

This popup offers value to customers by prolonging holiday giveaways. Visitors may already be familiar with Madewell’s holiday offers, but this popup informs them that holiday sales are still on.

**Respect**

Finally, an effective popup should pay your customers proper respect. Many websites make the mistake of using what is referred to as “offensive” copy in their opt-out buttons. Popups should not attempt to shame customers into accepting offers or opting in with phrases such as “I do not like to save money” or similar guilt-inducing sentences.

**Conclusion**

Contrary to popular belief, sales popups can actually be very interesting and useful as a tool to increase conversions. Their main advantage is they are instantaneous and provide information to your visitors without delay. However, they interrupt a visitor’s journey and need to be managed with care.

This is why popups should be as entertaining as possible. You can capture interest by presenting valuable and relevant information in a charming offer. Above all, ensure that the respectful content will allow visitors to maintain control of the interaction.

Conversion rates reach into over 50% for the best performing popups, making them a prime example of efficient marketing tactics for ecommerce stores. Now, it is up to you.

If this applies to you, realize you have roughly a month to pick your replacement if you don't want to interrupt service while getting the new system up and running. I personally put a ton of time into moving my company to SkuVault; Ultimately, it didn't work for us, but they were great and the price was good so I want to share it with others, so my work isn't just a waste. Here's what I like:

* Waaay less expensive than other options we're looking at.
* Support for serialized inventory.
* Pulls Shopify orders on UPDATE every 15 minutes - This is a big deal for me, as Shopify sucks at exchanges, so we're always editing orders and then having to manually update Stitch after. Many others only pull Shopify orders on creation, which is sub-optimal.
* Doesn't try to be everything to everyone, but it does inventory really well.

Why it didn't work for me: we have a specific need to be able to manually hold/release orders pushed to other software, and it just couldn't work the way we needed it to with SKUVault. Otherwise, it would have been perfect for us.

Our AOV is around $45, so this is quite large!

I responded to the email with our wholesale pricing. They responded quickly asking for an invoice including shipping so that they can provide their credit card information for payment.

I've never accepted such a large order before and I want to make sure to do this safely if it is indeed legit. What steps should I take here to ensure that I am not scammed?

shopify,"I run a craft chocolate shop operating in the UK. All my products are chocolate, nothing else. Website is: www.cloudcacao.co.uk.

I'm currently having some trouble getting my products listed on Google through the Google Merchant Center. Google says my account is suspended due to:

* Misrepresentation of self or product (Untrustworthy promotions) 

Looking in my GMC account it says my product data for all products is disapproved or invalid for Shopping Ads but Active for free listings for all but one listing (which bizarrely is disallowed for ""Forbidden pharmaceuticals or products making misleading claims""). The issue is:

&gt; Violation of Shopping ads policy 

I can see that my issue will fall into one of the four categories that covers shopping ads policies:

* Prohibited content;
* Prohibited practices;
* Restricted content; or
* Editorial &amp; technical requirements.

When I got a reply from Google at my attempt to request a re-review I was told the following:

&gt;Google’s primary objective is to provide safe, relevant experiences for  our users. The decision to suspend your account was made after careful  review of your account and the low quality landing page experiences  promoted through your website. We won't be able to provide you with any  further details regarding the suspension of the account. 

Based on this, and considering I do not sell prohibited or restricted content and I do not engage in prohibited practices, my issue is falling under Editiorial &amp; technical requirements.

I'm not sure it would be the product descriptions; these are as close to the suppliers descriptions as possible because I wanted to avoid any misrepresentation. I add some of my own comments, for example with the hot chocolate I recommend what milk I use. I take my own pictures as well because I want to make that aspect my own.

I have the required legal pages all listed in my footer.

On futher investigation I can only think that my issue might be the speed of my website on mobile. I ran every page I have through Lighthouse. My pages on desktop range from 88 - 100 with only two pages below 90. My pages on mobile are worse, ranging from 36 - 94. My lowest scoring pages are the product pages because of the product images, I believe, although Lighthouse says most of the problem stems from Google CDN.

My products are still being disapproved after I have been through and tidied up the pages as much as I can, implemented lazy loading, updated product images, and optimised the image sizes and I'm a bit lost for how to fix it.

Does anyone have any experience with this that might help me get the issue resolved?

 I've  shared multiple databases in past some with free access and some with  free-with-email-subscription. The free ones have very little usage in  terms of average time spent by user and other metrics.

I have experimented with these kind of products for a while and general human psychology is:

1. If it's free to access it's probably worthless
2. If it's free I'll come back and check it out later- and they never come back

I share results from these experiments in my newsletters for full transparency.

For my shopify store i'd like to add a try out product to increase our conversion rate. It is basicly a box with all our flavours for a heavily discounted price. But to make sure not everybody starts ordering that, it needs to have the following functionalities:

\- Users have to register an account before purchase

\- Every user can only buy the product once

\- The product can only be bought once per adress (to avoid people making new accounts).

shopify,"Every time we want to buy a product, we waste hours researching a product and reading reviews.

The biggest frustrations with online product research are:

1. Fake reviews
2. Sponsored content/ Ads
3. It takes time

Wouldn't it be great to have a service that solves all this for me?

That's why we are building [reviewr.ai](https://reviewr.ai/). It's like having a team of people reviewing products for you and summarizing the important points at a speed that would take hours to research on your own.

**How does it work?**

1. Fetching product reviews from your Shopify store.
2. Scraping reviews about your product from trusted sources on the web.
3. Running it through our fake detection
4. Doing a sentiment analysis
5. Our AI generates a brief and concise summary of all the reviews

**Example**

This is how such a summary looks like for [some leather boots](https://www.buyforlife.com/products/8/red-wing-shoes-iron-ranger):

* *The leather is thick and durable.*
* *Red Wing has an excellent track record for quality and durability.*
* *They last for years, and they can be resoled.*
* *Red Wings are well made with longevity in mind. With proper care, will last a long time.*
* *The boots have a timeless design that is versatile to wear with different outfits.*
* *The break-in period was about a month, but once broken in, the boots are very comfortable.*
* *Expensive but worth it.*

**What's next?**

We will soon launch our Shopify App. If you're interested in a free trial and giving us early feedback, signup for the beta [here](https://www.reviewr.ai/beta-signup).

shopify,"Hello all, another questions for y'all!

Background on my shopify business (launching this month once I figure out all the finer details, I have my inventory and product photography done.)- I will be selling handcraft wedding decor and favors from Pakistan. These are items used commonly in Indian/Pakistani weddings. The items are not particularly large or heavy but it does include sets of some items. For example, I have favor pouches. There are 3 different types, each type sells in a set of 4, with all 4 being different colors. (So one peach/pink/seagreen/gray theme set of pouches, one red/green/yellow/orange set of pouches, etc.) These will likely be sold in large quantities as its typically one pouch per guest. I also have other items that involve multiple parts (ex. a mirror tray with 3 types of cups used for a ceremony). In total, I have about 30 SKUs. 

I am currently paying $60 per month for a 5x10 storage unit. I have no free palce to put it. Can't use my garage as Texas heat will damage some of my products. And I am currently planning to ship everything myself, fulfillment centers for shopify is something I wasn't aware of before. 

I am just trying to get more info. I have reached out to a few centers myself for details but its hard to gauge any type of pricing, especially because all my products are so different and it's not like I sell just one type of thing, which is what im finding most info to be about. Do y'all think this is something to look into further at this time? Anyone know the cost? Or even just the type of cost- monthly, per order charge, etc?

shopify,"Hi all! I am kickstarting a venture that sells cultural wedding decor and favors. The majority of my products I have an inventory of here in the US and those will be shipped domestically easily, I understand how to handle all that. I have 2 specific favor box things that my vendor in Pakistan will custom make for every single order. These items come in 15 different color options and my vendor makes custom tags attached to them. With most weddings in our culture being easily 100+ guests and favors are one per person, you can see why it'd be hard for me to keep an inventory of this product. I'd need like 1000 of each color minimum (I expect this item to be quite popular, its very unique and I am pricing very reasonably).

My vendor has experience shipping this exact product to the US and other countries. Production is about 7-10 days and DHL takes 4-5 days to ship, so thats 2 weeks to prep and ship the product. I plan to keep the expected shipping time as 3 weeks on my shopify to be safe. I am confused how I will go about setting shipping for this product. I will have a flat rate price based on quantities (25/50 will be $40, 100 will be $60, 200+ will be $80). Any guidance or video suggestions would be fantastic as I can't find anything that shows me how to handle two ship out addresses. I hope that all made sense!

&gt;Hi Ankit,  
&gt;  
&gt;We're reaching out because your account and/or accounts you are the listed user on has received a high volume of disputes from your customers. Stripe is unable to support businesses with a dispute rate consistently above 1%.

In order to continue to support your business, you'll need to take action to reduce your dispute rates. To learn more about dispute prevention, see here: [https://stripe.com/docs/disputes/prevention](https://stripe.com/docs/disputes/prevention). If we don't see a decline in your dispute rates, we will have to take action on your account which may include holding funds in reserve or termination.  
To help you track and monitor your dispute activity, the Reports Overview section of your dashboard includes information about your disputes: [https://dashboard.stripe.com/dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/dashboard)  
If you have any questions, please reply directly to this email for assistance.

**Here was my response**

&gt;Hi  
It's not true, I have had zero disputes so far.  
Please check again  
Thanks

**Here was Stripe's response**

&gt;Hi Ankit,  
&gt;  
&gt;Thank you for reaching out Stripe Support.  
&gt;  
&gt;It's lovely to meet you! I hope your day is treating you well so far. Based on the thread, you have concerns with the email that we sent about high dispute risk. Thanks for your patience while we got back to you on this!  
&gt;  
&gt;I apologize for this, but don't worry, I'm checking this with my team for another look at your Stripe account. We'll be sure to get back in touch once we're done, or if we need additional information.  
&gt;  
&gt;In the meantime, please feel free to write in on thread if you have other concerns. I'm just an email away.  
&gt;  
&gt;Best regards,  
Roy

**Their reply, after a few days.**

&gt;Hi Ankit,  
We're writing to let you know that, after conducting a review of your business, we've found that it presents a higher level of risk than we are able to work with at this time.  
Transitioning off Stripe:  
We understand that moving away from Stripe can take time, so your service is not ending immediately. To help with the transition to a new payment processor, we're able to provide you 5 additional days (beginning today) to switch to a new provider. After this time, you won't be able to accept charges on your account.  
Because of the elevated risk associated with your account, your balance will be placed on reserve for the next 90 days (the industry-standard period during which most payments are disputed). During this time, the reserved funds will help cover any disputes or unforseen refunds on your account. The remaining balance (%E2%80%99[https://dashboard.stripe.com/balance/overview%E2%80%99](https://dashboard.stripe.com/balance/overview%E2%80%99)) will be paid out to your bank account at the end of this period.  
Why is this necessary?  
Stripe is obligated to cover any losses incurred by merchants in the event that they cease operations. As a result, we are required by law to complete several types of review for every business that signs up with us.  
We're also subject to strict requirements imposed by our partners in the payments ecosystem that dictate the level of risk that we're allowed to support. We use multiple sources of information as part of our reviews in order to determine whether or not businesses on Stripe conform to these policies and restrictions.  
We want to make very clear that we're not casting any doubts over the viability of your business. That said, your business is operating in an industry which is considered high risk by our financial partners, and for that reason, we have no option but to discontinue our service to you.  
If you need an alternative payment processor, we recommend considering [PaymentCloud](https://paymentcloudinc.com/stripe.), which works with businesses with a higher level of risk than we're able to support.  
We're sorry that we can't offer you ongoing service, and wish you the best of luck with your business.

Well, holy moly. If you're looking for Teespring millionaires that have gone on to create a brand juggernaut in the POD space, you've found them. I didn't check my emails as early as I normally would have this morning however when I did I was as excited as a teenage girl nailing her first TikTok dance.

Keegan and Corey are the industry kingpins, the Titans of t-shirts, the professors of print on demand, the kings of our industry.

I owe a lot of my own success to these guys as Keegan was our original coach back in the day when we were learning how to sell on Teespring.

This is their story so far, it's certainly nowhere near what they will achieve with the drive and determination these guys have.

They have done some crazy things from working with the guys from barstool sports to the heavyweight champion of the world Mike Tython.

**Number of founders:** 2  
**Number of employees (excluding founders):** 170

## App Stack

**Klaviyo** \- If you aren't emailing daily, you are leaving tons of money on the table. If you are cloning/duplicating without changing out images, products, or content, you are emailing half-assed.

If you provide genuine content and great emails, your emails can generate thousands of dollars in sales a day. We really love the functionality and ease of using Klaviyo vs other services.

**LOOX Reviews** \- This review app is awesome! It really incentivizes your customers to send in reviews along with pictures.

The best part is it's 90% automated. We have a team member who approves reviews and passes along great fan photos to the marketing team for email and social purposes.

**Bulk Product Edit** \- Time management is key in this business. If you waste a ton of time doing manual things when you could automate a task, you're losing money. Spend time doing revenue generating tasks.

Bulk Product Edit allows you to quickly change SKU's, product descriptions, etc. Set it, and forget it.

**Attentive:** SMS Marketing is the latest trend in reaching your customers where they spend time at. Do you spend more time texting friends &amp; family or checking emails? That should answer any question you have in regard to SMS marketing.

We have used Attentive for close to 2 years now. To me, there is nobody that comes close to the amount of customer service, training, help, etc. that you get from Attentive, when it comes to App partners.

## Q. Where are you based? Do you have a family? What do you do for work and fun?

We are based out of Clayton, North Carolina

### Keegan Rush

I live in Garner, NC. I have lived in North Carolina my entire life and would never want to change that. Whenever we travel to cities like New York, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, etc.

I always return with a sense of gratitude for how much I love where I am from and where my family is. Our roots are firmly planted in North Carolina and I wouldn't want to leave for any reason.

I do have a family and wouldn't change them for the world. My amazing wife Sara and 1-year old son Boston are the reason I attack every day with the mentality to level up to give them a better life.

For work, I sell stuff online, whilst building brands with the ultimate goal of selling as much stuff as physically possible. **My goal is to always improve the lives of those I surround myself with**. I want to provide a better life for my family, partners, clients, employees, suppliers, etc., and their families.

That can be done by selling more stuff and growing the business. For fun, I love to spend time with family and friends, drive my Audi R8 fast, and sell stuff. Most would call that ""work"", but I genuinely love to sell stuff, so it doesn't feel like work to me.

I'm also a big Chicago sports fan, as well as a Duke Blue Devil fan. Sports has always been a staple in our lives, which has instilled an intense level of competition.

That level of competition has helped us aggressively scale the business but, also to take office Ping-Pong way too seriously. You take the good, with the bad right?

### Corey Rush

Angier, NC is where I call home. I've got an awesome and very supporting wife Elizabeth, and 3 of the coolest kids ever in Carson, Piper, and Palmer.

If we aren't at the ball field with Carson, we enjoy hanging outdoors with the grill on; and the wine pouring! WORK for me personally is fun, when we made the decision to build this e-commerce thing into a true business; it was a decision to do what we loved and what we were pretty darn good at.

Outside of my Family and the Blue Pack Squad; I enjoy really good Wine (Caymus, Far Niente, and Plumpjack are my favorites). We set a goal to buy supercars, so I purchased an original McLaren 12C and it's been LOADS of FUN.

**It drives very much like how we run Blue Pack Marketing, FAST and STRONG!**

## Q. What did you do before becoming a ecommerce millionaire?

### Keegan Rush

Before discovering Teespring and becoming an internet marketer, I worked in retail at a Sports Memorabilia store and ran a couple of websites on the side.

📷

**I learned Photoshop, basic coding, and in general became very computer literate**, which led to being able to design my first round of initial designs that took off. That was the inspiration I needed to eventually become a Teespring millionaire, and inevitably an ecommerce millionaire.

The combination of retail, plus computer literacy, definitely gave me a leg up on the competition before becoming one of the first teespring millionaires.

After running successfully by myself for 6 months, I decided to ask my big brother for help with the ""business"" aspect, and he initially helped with the books and taxes. After seeing the massive potential, he came on as a partner, and we formalized everything, he left his corporate job, and we attacked this full time with 2 minds, instead of 1.

We launched [Blu Pack Marketing](https://bluepackmarketing.com/) and It's been scaling higher and higher by the day. Now we have an awesome team at Blue Pack, with like-minded individuals who attack every day, as hungry as the day before.

### Corey Rush

Prior to starting Blue Pack Marketing with my brother, I was working my way up the corporate ladder with the Couche-Tarde (Circle K Convenience/Gas) organization. I operated as a Director at the age of 28 and controlled up to 3 states over 150 stores/2,000 employees during my tenure.

The corporate world while rewarding and exciting simply wasn't one for me. My brother Keegan and I had started 3-4 smaller ventures prior to creating Blue Pack Marketing; 2 of which were very successful so we knew we worked well together.

So when we decided we were going to double down on this ""online selling"" thing; I did what any normal guy would do......I went home and told my pregnant wife, in our brand new home that I was quitting my job to sell stuff online with my brother. Little did she know at the time that we'd soon be Teespring millionaires.

She supported me the whole way, and we have never looked back.

## Q. How often do you launch new products?

Before becoming Teespring millionaires we would launch as many campaigns as possible.

Now, we launch 1-2 new products a week. We have a vast array of outlets to test these products whether it's Facebook Lives, a Facebook Group, Email List, SMS List, Social Posts to track engagement, etc.

If you go to bat twice and strike out twice, you're 0/2 and forgettable. If you go to bat 10 times a month and get on base 4 times, you're batting .400 and in the hall of fame with that average.

&amp;#x200B;

## Q. Where do most of your customers come from? Google search? Social Media? Other sites?

Facebook is our main vehicle for sales if you look at %'s however email, Instagram, and Google Shopping are contributing larger chunks to the sales engine by the day. Instead of trying to be superstars in everything, we've built up team members and partners to be the Michael Jordan of their own specific area.

Corey and I put the lion's share of our ad focus into Facebook while we have somebody specifically handling the other sales channels. A lot of focus, testing, and reading is required to stay up to date on all of the recent Facebook algo changes.

I think we have always been great at maneuvering the waters during change, to not only stay profitable but also to see the growth even when things are down for most others. Part of that speaks to the power of the brand in our stores.

People visit brands, they don't visit pop-up T-Shirt shops that look fly by night-ish. If you were to turn off all ads, between email and organic traffic, we have a couple of brands that would still do 7 figures a year easily.

## Q. I’d love to hear more about your ecommerce successes to date. What great things have come to you through building your success and growing your store? Would love to hear a story.

There are a couple of stories that immediately stand out when I think of our successes, being among the first teespring millionaires was definitely one of those moments.

**1.)** **We have generated over $250,000,000+ in sales**, possibly more if we had more accurate tracking on some brick &amp; mortar, television, and local work we've completed over time. This is from brands that we own and/or platform sales over the years.

It also includes wholesale channels into brick &amp; mortar boutiques and stores. We have had 1 brand in over 200+ locations that we eventually sold. Our current brand is in over 700 retail locations and trending to be in over 1,500 by the end of the year.

We've built this wholesale pipeline from the ground up and are now executing at a really high level. We have taken a Shopify brand and cultivated a wholesale distribution channel, which to my knowledge hasn't been done on this scale.

**2.)** We have successfully exited 2 Shopify/E-Com companies in the 6-figure range. We are hoping our next major acquisition is in the 8 figure range and current valuations dictate that.

**3.)** We made it a goal to both be driving supercars. One day Corey mentioned that we should go do it and within 72 hours, Corey had a McLaren and I (Keegan) had an Audi R8. Now we want to outfit all of our team members in supercars.

It will make driving past our office each day a true spectacle.

**4.)** We've always worked in the e-com space, we have had multiple relationships that approach us about advertising in other arenas. We accept clients based on relationships, compared to seeking them out ourselves.

### Success with Serious Brand Power

We took on some work for the History Channel. We were able to rank a TV show in the Top 50 most-watched programs in the United States that night. It went up against a competitor's similar show, who did the national talk show circuit with Ellen, Fallon, Conan, etc.

We ranked in the Top 50, they were ranked 83. It was a very small advertising budget but, we were able to crush it and make waves on a national stage. It was a success because we had no idea what to expect from the results being that we're sellers in the ecom space.

We've amplified the client side of our business and most notably handled the stores for Mike Tyson, The Hodge Twins, and Donald Trump Jr.

It showed that a lot of our principles can be applied across multiple industries.

## Q: What platform/tools do you use for your business?

Full QuickBooks integration with an accounting department to ensure all invoices are checked for accuracy.

Sometimes an invoice might accidentally have 3-4 extra items in it, with multiple suppliers, multiple brands, that can easily add up over the course of a year, you need to be very careful.

We now have in-house developers vs utilizing an agency for conversion rate optimization. This allows for more dedicated focus, nimble movement, and a function of deeper caring.

Having a team member who looks at that like it is their own baby has been a very pivotal change for us. In a massive business, moving the needle 1% is huge. We try to do that multiple times throughout the year to find savings, that we can redeploy as investment capital.

## Q. What’s your number 1 tip for new dropshippers getting into the industry?

Structure your business from the start, don't let the money fool you! Early on, before becoming Teespring millionaires, we learned to follow a structured system.

Statistics simply aren't on your side as an entrepreneur with over 90% of ventures never operating in the black. **(Profitable).**

Throughout the last 5 years and companies that we have started and sold (That's right we have built up Shopify Brands and SOLD THEM); if your supply chain/organizational structure/customer service isn't all on the same page.....YOU WILL FAIL.

Unfortunately, this isn't something that is managed by an application, or something that a virtual assistant can do off the bat; it's something that will require you to lay out a very detailed game plan.

The other part about the structure that many e-commerce teams struggle with is tracking financials and actually analyzing them. Are you winning on shipping? Product weights correct? Accounting for larger sizes?

Are you accounting correctly for expenses? These are all questions that if you don't STRUCTURE from the start, there is a higher chance that your business will end up failing.

Don't take in money, pay invoices and ad spend, and assume the rest is profit. Make sure you're tracking your expenses and profit daily.

We do this 7 days a week and account for every dollar divided by 30 days a month for accurate tracking/accounting.

## Q. Where can people find out more about you? Is there anything else you’d like to share?

You can check us out on [BluePackMarketing.Com](https://bluepackmarketing.com/) \- We don't seek out new clients, we generally like to take on cool projects or ones that stem from relationships.

If you have a cool opportunity, please feel free to reach out to us. We would love to give a major shout-out to our team. Everybody plays a very important part in our story and the development of our brands and projects we work on.

Our goal is to be on an island, and we plan to bring the entire team with us when the major acquisitions start happening. If I were to expand on how awesome each of them is, this part would be longer than the entire article.

Shout out to others that we have met along the way. It's been a fun ride, and we plan to keep this locomotive rolling.

Also, dibs on all sales, on all advertising channels.

P.S. Shout out to our parents and family as well. Love you guys and appreciate all of you!

shopify,"Hello,

I've seen a couple similar posts where people have just been laughed at or told they will get no where but, I'm hoping I can have some luck by being more specific.

1) I want to open a Shopify drop shipping store, I have a small budget and some ideas but really am having a hard time honing in and making some decisions. I have some design experience but not enough to build a converting store. I have some pretty specific goals, not just ""i wanna be a millionaire by next week""

What I can bring to the table is a consistent budget, nothing major - but consistent. What I'm looking for is someone to help me make some decisions, design the shop and run the marketing, and teach me how to support the upkeep. I know returns wont come right away and may take a few months. Let's split the profit once I recoup my investments for as long as you're helping me.

I'd love to see what you've built.

Or...

2) Maybe you have an existing store that's doing some pretty good traction and for whatever reason, the idea of an investor is exciting to you. Again, I don't have much, but I can consistently invest in return for a share of your profits.

Hopefully I get something out of this! I'm essentially just trying to put myself through school and am trying to not work my 9-5 fulltime for a couple years.

I haven't come across any posts relating to my question. So on my Shopify website, I'm selling a box with the following: one pencil, one eraser, and one notebook. That's the only box I'm selling.

My 3PL has 3 SKUs for the pencils, erasers, and notebooks because they came from different manufacturers. Once I get an order, the 3PL will put these items in the box for me.

So I went viral on one of my facebook posts and had a insane number of orders this week around $20k in orders, Right away my payouts were put on hold and I was required to submit an id and other general information, which I did. My payouts were then enabled. Now today they were again disabled, so I contacted support and the support team forwarded me to the risk management team. and i am now awaiting a email from them, they only operate monday-friday so I probably wont hear back till monday.

I went over the Shopify Tos and im selling NOTHING illegal nor am I lieing about the products im selling. I have had 0 chargebacks. I have had to refund 10-20 people because a item i was selling went out of the stock, so could that be a reason why this happened?

I have a couple questions,

Should I fulfill all the orders I got? - Im worried since if I fulfill them what if Shopify makes me refund everyone? And If I don't fulfill them they can arrive late and that can lead to chargebacks.

Should I stop payments on my site? - Im getting more orders every hour

Should I start migrating to another eCommerce site? - I want to make sure im up and running in the worst case scenario my site is closed

Should I maybe accept another payment provider? - Theres a lot of other payment providers on their site I can connect im just not sure which one I should choose if I should accept another one.

Sorry for all the questions and would love some help on this.

Now, if I run ads for that store for a couple of weeks and nothing converts, do I open another store from scratch ( and also pay that 29$ for the basic plan on shopify) or do I edit the same store for the new product that I want to launch?

My friend and I recently launched our shop: [deskr.shop/](https://deskr.shop/) and we're currently shipping within the US only. We've received an overwhelmingly good response on our products since launch and have been asked, on a daily-basis, ""when are we going to be shipping international?"" Being that this is our first ecommerce site on the Shopify platform, we have fully tackled US-based shipping and order processing. We want to move into International shipping but we understand that there are quite a few requirements and rules for shipping into an international customers country. To give you insight on where we are at, here are a few details on our progress into International Shipping:

* Zonos Duties &amp; Taxes App Integration (Shopify App)
* FedEx Carrier Account Setup (Shipping Carrier connection)

Both of these resources are what we are currently working with in order to take that step into International shipping. 

Since we can't just simplify international shipping to just that singular allocation, we would like to describe what countries/regions that are on our radar for opening up. We'd like to start shipping internationally in:

* Canada
* United Kingdom
* Germany
* Sweden
* Netherlands
* Poland
* Denmark, etc.

Our knowledge of VAT is very limited but we do understand Brexit has caused certain changes on parcels entering either the UK or EU. We have searched dozens of forums and looked through many posts but to no avail, we can't find anything that can help us with creating and registering for UK/EU VAT and HMRC setup. Majority of our international site-visitors are from the UK and the EU region, and this is where we get asked the most about when we will go international. 

We are looking for assistance regarding this obstacle for taking our shop into International shipping and we want to know from the community if there are resources or advice, from experience, on how to take our shop into International shipping. If there is an ecommerce consultation company, or an ecom-guru that can push us into International shipping, we'd be immensely gratified. 

Thank you to those who give any sort of advice or direction, we appreciate any and all advice!How to take our shop into International Shipping?"

shopify,"Hey folks !   


I'm digging the shopify world to find out if it would fit my needs.

My customer would like to be able to purchase product at a specific moment.   
So I saw yesterday that shopify allows to schedule product. 

But after digging, when you schedule a product, you don't see at all on the front-end. 

She would like to open to purchase once day a week. So the D-day we will be able to purchase, but the other days of the week, we still need to be show the products.

My question is : is it possible to have a full control of collection page ? I mean to get all product via a specific request ? 

I already develop something similar on wordpress/woocommerce, but my client would like to be on shopify because she used to use it.

Do not propose me to publish the product with quantity at 0 ... she actually does that for now, it is her pain point, because every d-day, she needs to change the quantity at the opening day \^\^

I also found this cheat sheet [https://www.shopify.com/partners/shopify-cheat-sheet](https://www.shopify.com/partners/shopify-cheat-sheet)   
but apparently, there is nothing to query ... for example, collections.products only returns 50 published products. What if we would like 75, or 100 ?   


I have the feeling that it could be achieve by creating a next or nuxt.js front-end app, with rest api or graphql. But not directly with a template theme shopify.

shopify,"Yesterday I posted a question on r/ecommerce. Here is the link to my post: https://www.reddit.com/r/ecommerce/comments/lwyr4w/im_set_to_launch_my_ecommerce_businesswebsite_i_a/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf



Basically, I explained that I currently have a wix e-commerce website that I am set to launch in a couple months. I honestly like the interface of wix and the look of the website I created. However, I’ve heard a lot of bad things about wix. 

There’s mixed sentiment in my post from yesterday but the majority of the comments say that for larger scale businesses Shopify is the way to go and that if I think my business will grow, it’s worth switching now rather than later.

Yesterday, I started a Shopify account and played around with their interface and honestly so far I’m not too fond of it. It doesn’t seem nearly as customizable and there seems to be fewer features. In order to get the look I want, it seems like I have to purchase a new theme. And then if I decide I don’t like it, then I’m out that cost?Obviously I’m new to this and could be wrong and that’s why I came here to post this. 


Basically, Ive had no problems with wix but everyone loves Shopify and there has to be reasons I’m not seeing. I know wix received a lot of hate years ago but it seems like they’ve improved dramatically in e-commerce and digital marketing. 

I appreciate anyone’s advice or perspective you can offer. Thank you.What makes Shopify better than Wix?"

it's kind of confusing and would appreciate if someone gives me a run down for the fees and which they think is best to use in terms of protection, how quick we get the money and such.

shopify,"Long story short: I had a developer build several private apps for our specific needs. Now one of them isn't working properly. The last time I talked to the dev, he recommended it was probably best to rebuild them and I haven't heard from him since.

The apps synchronize inventory with a niche marketplace through both APIs, show inventory levels locally and at our supplier with different messages and send an automated email to our supplier when stock is needed. It also does a little bit of inventory management.

shopify,"Long story short, back in December we reshipped some orders that were already in transit because they were delayed and would arrive too late, and requested the customers send back the original shipments once they arrived. We did not double charge for the merchandise and trusted that they would hold up their end of the bargain, which they did.

However, an inadequately trained returns associate then refunded those returned orders, thinking they were RMAs, meaning the customer ultimately both received their order AND got their money back.

None of the customers said anything about this even though we did them a huge favor...

I just noticed this mixup while conducting an audit but it's now been about 2 months since. Thoughts on whether it be unprofessional to go back to the customers and request repayment at this time?

shopify,"Hi,

I have a customer that has tried multiple times to order from us but their orders would get cancelled due to our fraud filter app.

They even emailed us and asked us what was going on.  In case this was a legit order, I told them nicely that Shopify declined their order due to suspected fraud.  

Anyway, after 8 attempts, they somehow got it right and the fraud filters are saying their orders are legit.  Should I process their order?  I’m worried because it’s a very expensive order ($8k).

Update #1:

I emailed them and told them honestly that we would cancel all orders going forward due to the level of risk with an order of this size. I also told them if they wired the funds we could process the order.

At the suggestion of ruedumonde, we’re moving forward with a better app/company to help protect us called clear.sale.

I have two blogs, each blog have own articles, and when I get to an article I want to show previous and next article if they exist, that was done by sorting with PUBLISHED_AT and query “created_at” greather or lesser than, but, first problem is when its first ever article result for previous is shown as same article - this is easy to sort with array filter, the last one is a problem, last one and one before dont show previous article at all, not even wrong one, every other until then shows correctly, so my actual question is what is connection between publishedAt and created_at (maybe I missunderstood API docs) - I can change publish date in shopify admin but there is no response of created_at as in GQL query - is this the same thing? Next question is what is proper datetime format for created_at GQL query.

shopify,"Anyone (Shopify store owner) get ridiculous billing adjustments from UPS. 

I am a sole owner and don’t have time to be chasing them down and disputing everything. 

From incorrect box dimensions to address “corrections” it all seems like a scam to me. 

And yes we have set dimensions on each product so none of that changes and I always over estimate weight.

I know they were involved in a class action lawsuit for this same reason in 2011. 

The most recent thing they did that pissed me off was failing to deliver a package to a customer because they “don’t have record of the name matching the address in their database” like HUH? Ship the package where my customer requested it wtf!!! And then they “returned to sender” but we never received anything so by the time we were alerted of the failure to deliver it was “past” their claim period and they wouldn’t do anything about it 🤡🤡🤡

shopify,"Ilana Davis, the leading expert in accessibility and ADA compliance joined me for three episodes of [Pitstop](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/lucas-walkers-pitstop/id1539922392).

##**Episode 1 - Upgrading your Homepage without a Redesign**

[Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0HIgJyDxA0qVu1aOfjxNWQ?si=RWSVw3huQISSZogdLg1KSw) / [Apple](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/rescue-your-shopify-page-by-streamlining-presentation/id1539922392?i=1000510713219). 8:56

###**Key Takeaways**

* Less is more; don't overwhelm the consumer with countless product options, special deals, or flashy image carousels
* Concentrate what is shown by presenting only your primary products upfront on your homepage
* Know what your customers come to you for, and focus on that specific product or service
* Don't over-complicate or add steps to purchasing a product; if there's an image of what you are selling on your page, clicking on it should bring the customer to a page where they can buy it
* Avoid turning you page into a maze, if customers can't quickly find their way back to the product they want, they'll leave

##**Episode 2 -  Maximize Website Conversions By Making Product Tabs Taboo**

[Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/episode/13N7zMUVmi5jtFY4gXDxTM?si=5POf4n58SZOBE2YogDTQ8g) / [Apple](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/maximize-website-conversions-by-making-product-tabs-taboo/id1539922392?i=1000510852418) 9:17

###**Key Takeaways**

* Hiding these details behind a variety of tabs confuse and irritate visitors, rather than effectively presenting the information they want.
* The same information can be displayed further down or in images
* Product tabs can effect SEO, and tabs can hide it from GooglePresenting this information clearly and upfront will increase not only website conversions, but also external traffic.

##**Episode 3 - Easy Ways you Can Make Your Site More Accessible**
[Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4Zekty0M4gXyKnu0nnn32C?si=BrJW5P9qT2W7MmNaEiBIyw) / [Apple](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/embrace-accessibility-to-increase-product-visibility/id1539922392?i=1000510949674) 11:36

###**Key Takeaways**

* Don't dismiss accessibility just because your product isn't primarily for disabled customers; 20% of consumers have a disability in one form or another
* Optimize your pages for screen reader apps and programs
* Add alt-text descriptions to any images included, especially product images
* Use clearly contrasting texts and backgrounds, rather than over-designed fonts or funky tones
* Accessibility advantages don't just allow and drive engagement and sales from those who suffer from restrictions or disabilities, they make shopping an easier and more enjoyable experience for all customers.

shopify,"Okay. So I'm in the process of buying a house (super excited, super nervous) and I know I can't make any large purchases and avoid opening new credit cards or taking out loans. Is Shopify Capital a loan in the same sense that it may get flagged by the mortgage underwriter? I don't wanna screw up my mortgage, but I also know shopify capital preapproval only appears for \~30 days if you dont accept so mine will expire before I close on the house. Otherwise, I would just wait till after closing to even consider it. My business is a Sole Proprietorship so if it ends up as a loan on my credit its technically personal (even though its for the business). So my question is, is this all in house with shopify and not reported anywhere else, or do I need to just ignore it and hope they approve me again later?

shopify,"One of the key complaints about shopify is that the internal pages don't have a nice drag and drop builder like the home page. It has been on the road map for quite some time but we are still waiting on the feature. You could install a page builder app to help you achieve this but from a design perspective you can end up with different fonts, sizes and colors if you are not careful and making a simple change can become quite difficult to remain consistent across the site. There is also the issue of page speed to consider. 

You can have homepage sections on internal pages and allow for completely different sections on each page. It does take developer skills and a knowledge of shopify's schema to create this but it can be done. Below is the base Debut theme that comes with shopify that we are all familiar with. If you click around the base site you will see the usual pages with some basic content on there. 

**Base theme** \- [https://debut-theme-sections-all-pages.myshopify.com?preview\_theme\_id=120133222449](https://debut-theme-sections-all-pages.myshopify.com?preview_theme_id=120133222449)

This next link brings you to the same site but loads a more advanced debut theme that I modified to allow sections on all pages. You can navigate to the same pages as before but you will see that the layout is very different and there are now home page sections on every page. 

**Theme with sections on all pages** \- [https://debut-theme-sections-all-pages.myshopify.com?preview\_theme\_id=42965893169](https://debut-theme-sections-all-pages.myshopify.com?preview_theme_id=42965893169)

&amp;#x200B;

If you had access to the theme you would see that the customize theme section for each page has a new ""Customize Page"" sidebar menu where you can add content. These sections can be customized and moved around quite easily, just like on the homepage. I have included some quick screenshots for this.

shopify,"Hey [r/shopify](https://www.reddit.com/r/shopify/),

Dan here from EZ Order Tracking, a Shopify App that creates a mobile-friendly Order Tracking page on your store.

It's been 5 months since we started building the app and TODAY it is finally available to download on the official [Shopify App Store](https://apps.shopify.com/ezot?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=shopify&amp;utm_campaign=promo-launch).

We decided to build EZ Order Tracking because the current order tracking apps are old and outdated, but most importantly because they **cost a lot**.

You don't have to sell a kidney anymore just to get your very own tracking page, but don't confuse a low price point with less functionality.

# A few things about what EZ Order Tracking can do for you

1. Get a mobile-optimized order tracking page in less than 60 seconds. **Just install the app, click enable and you are all set.**
2. Easily edit anything on the page. Is your store in French, German, Spanish, or maybe Japanese? **It doesn't matter.** You can edit every little piece of text on your tracking page so it will match with your store's language. But that's not all, you can change the colors as well. Everyone knows that branding is important, so we made it extremely easy to change the color scheme as well.
3. Automatically send emails to your customers when their order status is changing. You can either set the emails inside the app or just connect EZ Order Tracking with Klaviyo.
4. Cross-sell at just the right time. The order tracking page is not just a place for your customers to see where their shipment is at. With the cross-selling functionality, you can show your customers any product of your choice, which will help you get sale after sale.
5. Track orders shipped by 100+ carriers. If you work with a courier company that has more than 2 vans and 4 employees, EZ Order Tracking will work for you.

# We want to help small businesses grow

We ran a pre-launch exclusive right here a few months ago, so if you are one of the early adopters check your email for directions on how to redeem your special plan.

Of course, we wouldn't post in this community without another special promo: install EZOT in the next 30 days and secure the **free forever plan featuring:**

* all current features;
* all upcoming updates;
* track up to 30 orders per month;
* send up to 90 emails per month;

We will keep up the free forever plan until the 25th of March 2021 because of the high costs associated with order tracking. But if you secure yours now you can keep it forever and ever.

shopify,"I just changed up my store, a lot. I think it looks great, but can I get some feedback on my store? [https://tronscases.com/](https://tronscases.com/)Store feedback"
shopify,"Hey Guys,

So I am a semi-professional dropshipper- scaled about 3 products so far.... idk if thats even semi professional but had a quick question.

Just tested a new product this week and it seems to be a winner. 2 CBOs exact duplicate of each other have 3+ ROAS, another 1 CBO has 2.55 ROAS and 1 Adset level budget campaign has 4.60 ROAS. Have about 30 purchases and overall Return of 3.00.

Now, this is usually the easiest and funnest part for me, based on past experiences. All I do at this point when returns are awesome is duplicate the CBOs and not touch a single thing except DOUBLE the budget to the point where i had 10 CBOS spending $100 daily or so making about 2-5K in sales with 3+ ROAS.

Anyways, I tried to duplicating my winning CBOS even with the same budget but I realized that most of them end up doing absolutely terrible compared to the original CBO and sometimes even affects the original CBO negatively.. For example if I duplicated the winning CBO today BOTH may do terribly tomorrow. Another thing I realized is that the CBO will do bad one day than amazing the next- evening out for the week and remaining profitable. Basically kind of inconsistent from day to day but still profitable...

This kinda freaks me out because with the first winner I had, I just kept duplicating the first testing CBO with higher budgets and they all did fairly the same Return and consistent sales, 10% give or take.

Now down to the question... How do you guys think I should scale this? Should I duplicate that CBO again for the third time and add a higher budget? Or just increase the budget by 20% daily? Also Have you guys noticed the CBOs being inconsistent lately as well?

Looking forward to hearing back from you guys.The Best Way to Scale Winning CBOS with 3+ROAS"

Selected top-four target audience with the highest number of View content. Created another conversion campaign for view content with top engaged ad posts and top performed target audience.

shopify,"Lookalike audiences are overrated... sometimes.

&amp;#x200B;

I've seen so many ad accounts that are struggling to get just their first 50 sales from Facebook ads, and most of their audiences are Lookalike audiences created from data that they do not have enough of.

&amp;#x200B;

I understand how Lookalike audiences can sound great in theory... you tell Facebook to use the pixel data from the 30 purchases you have on your store to turn those 30 customers into millions of similar customers.

&amp;#x200B;

But the reality is... if you don't give Facebook enough data in terms of *quantity* AND *quality*, that Lookalike audience will not perform well. Something that people often neglect is the data that Facebook has accumulated for many years. And that is interest based audiences.

&amp;#x200B;

[Here are some results comparing interest ad sets to a Lookalike audience ad set](https://i.imgur.com/Ndv6gBD.png)

&amp;#x200B;

This ad account was relying heavily on Lookalike audiences before I started working on it, so we left one of those ad sets on to see if it would be beaten by an interest audience. And it was 3 times.

&amp;#x200B;

If you have experienced similar results when launching ads towards Lookalike audiences, then you can either

1. **Try a different type of Lookalike audience (different data source or different percentage) with the same budget**
2. **Use that budget towards an interest audience instead**

&amp;#x200B;

The problem with Lookalike audiences is that it can cost you a lot of money to know what that sweet spot combination of data source and percentage point is. This is because of the quality and quantity required.

&amp;#x200B;

**Scenario 1 (High quality, low quantity):** You've gotten 20 sales on your store of your perfect customer. Creating a purchase Lookalike might not work well without more data (or it could work, you never know unless you test it).

&amp;#x200B;

**Scenario 2 (High quantity, low quality):** You've had 20,000 visitors to your website in the last 90 days. But what if only 0.2% of them are customers. That would probably not work either due to the low amount of quality buyers in that audience.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's the take home with this...

* Don't neglect interest audiences in favor of Lookalikes all the time
* Don't always assume that a purchase Lookalike audience will always outperform a traffic or add to cart Lookalike audience

&amp;#x200B;

Hope that helps! I'm happy to answer any specific questions you have.For Shopify stores using Lookalike audiences in their Facebook Ads"

shopify,"Hi Guys,  


Im having a little bit of a head scratcher with how Shopify handles different situations for Refunds / Returns and Exchanges.  


Straight refunds are fair enough - the customer has sent back the product and wants a refund. We receive the product back and process the refund.  


An exchange however is a little confusing, we receive back the product, remove the item from the original order, add a new item - and collect the balance of whats owed or refund whats left over. But not always does Shopify give us the option to capture payment for this.  


Editing an order is another issue for us - a customer gets in contact before shipment to say they wanted a different size for example - we remove the item from the order and restock it, and add a new item. It doesn't seem to be calculating the balance correctly - it often asks for more money from the customer.  


What are your correct procedures for doing this, maybe we are going about restocking / adding or removing products from an order incorrectly.  


This is for the base Shopify with no additional applications.  


ThanksShopify Refund / Return / Exchange query."

shopify,"Came across this article and thought I'd share. Summary below, [link to dig deeper](https://www.mayfield.com/mayfield-ecommerce-of-the-future-forum/) and not just read the headlines if that's your jam.

2020 has left an enduring mark on the consumer landscape. Years of change have happened in weeks, and products rarely bought online are now ecommerce staples. Q2 2020 saw a 44% YoY growth of U.S. online sales, and eCommerce will be more than 19% of all retail for 2020, up from 14% in 2019. However, as traditional comes back online in 2021, its impact on eCommerce remains to be seen.

Key Takeaways

* eCommerce needs agility and flexibility now more than ever. Adapting to sudden change on the fly is no longer optional.
* Go custom to compete with Amazon. Real enthusiasts who know their stuff care about the brand they buy. People go to Amazon to save money on products they have already identified, but it’s rarely the place they start with net new discovery.
* D2C is coming into its own, but it has become clear that you can’t rely on brick and mortar or Amazon. D2C needs its own channel.
* Security is a rising priority. Ransomware is everywhere and businesses are very vulnerable.
* Consumer expectations around precision have changed. People want to know when their packages are arriving, and specifically where they are in the process. They also want speed. Many customers will buy a lesser brand if they know it will arrive sooner.
* Segmentation is critical around customer acquisition. Marketing to the right segments either based on past sales, views, stage of the customer journey, or other factors is the way of the future.Ecommerce of the Future Forum"

I told them I need these products ASAP and asked what I should do. They said I should get it soon. FedEx won’t give me any info where it is. I needed more products so they said it should be fine to order more as storms have quieted down.
-Second order placed Feb 15th- still don’t have it. FedEx can’t tell me where it is just they’re busy and the weather set them back. 
-Spoke with them Monday, they offered to reprint and ship expedited both orders at no charge if the statuses didn’t change later that day.
-No changes to status so they created a new order but only did it for the first orders quantity... wtf!!!!
-Was on the phone with them for hours then finally they said they could add more quantity if I paid more. I did because I’m desperate. They guaranteed these would ship out yesterday, ship 1 day hair FedEx, and I’d get them today.

shopify," I struggled with Facebook ads and choosing the right strategy to test products and campaigns for the first few years of trying to run an eCommerce store. I have finally landed on a strategy that works well and is showing me great results and I wanted to share it with you guys. These results are actually achieved with a private-labeled but not proprietary brand, but if you are running an even stronger business model - you should be able to use this for WAY better results.

Proof: [February Sales](https://imgur.com/a/WDIWEBk) (This screenshot was taken halfway through the month, close to doing 60k at this point)

What may surprise you is **this strategy isn’t extremely complicated and doesn’t involve spending hours and hours on end in your ads manager** trying to micromanage the Facebook ai (hint, let the ai do the work for you)

The results pictured are ONLY using interest-based testing and I am currently not running a single lookalike audience.

I wanted to make this post before I launched lookalikes showing you what is possible with just top of funnel interest-based campaigns (I have one basic retargeting campaign running right now, but 95% of the sales are cold traffic)

The Strategy is broken out into two phases: testing and scaling and I made a quick video in the ads manager detailing exactly how to implement it:

Video: [Link](https://youtu.be/MplflU9ZqnU)

This testing and scaling strategy is not only easy to implement but it’s also super easy to manage because you don’t have hundreds of campaigns and different objectives to monitor and optimize.

I really hope this helps with your Facebook ads strategy and helps you absolutely crush it this spring. As always, don’t hesitate to reach out or comment any questions below and I will do my best to answer.

PS. Some of you may already know this, and I want to give a ton of credit to Nick Peroni for coming up with this strategy (I tweaked it a bit to suit my own needs), but I just wanted to show that implemented properly it can absolutely crush it.$30,000 in 2 Weeks - The Complete Easy Peazy Testing/Scaling Strategy 🚀"
shopify,"What you are probably missing to become successful at ecommerce?

In this post, I’m going to explain what exactly I have changed in my approach **to get to $65k in Sales** in 2 months. I’ve been in the game for over 1.5 years with very inconsistent results, until in last October, I realized that if I don’t change my approach, I am destined to never become profitable.

* **First problem** was the fact that I was **losing too much on testing** because I was hoping that the product will start doing better If I let the campaign run for 1 more day and 1 more after that and so on. So, instead of spending a maximum of $100 on testing the product, some failed product tests cost me upwards of $800 and more. Thus, I needed to implement a clear strategy to determine when to cut the losses and move on.
* **Second problem was that I was copying** and pasting the content and ads of the competitors and was hoping that if a product is a winner, it will make me rich anyway. This was obviously a huge mistake, because my ad quality was crappy and the CPMs and CTRs were extremely poor, and my landing pages were also weaker because they weren’t unique or original.
* **Third problem** is that I was always using **saturated products**, and even when I was profitable during testing, I was always failing to scale the product because the audiences that I was targeting already saw this same exact ad and same exact product countless of times.

So, given all these weaknesses of mine, I decided that it is important to drastically change my approach and starting to put in more time for building out a decent looking general store, writing my own product descriptions, making my own video ads and most importantly, selecting the profitable medium high-ticket niche and test unique products that were not tested before by others. Initially, results were quite unsatisfactory, but every day I was improving at a great pace, and within the last week of November, **I finally found a winner.**

At this stage, I decided that it is important for me to get outside help with scaling the product, because I already have had failures trying to scale good performing products, so, I outsourced my ads management and focused on improving my store and improving my conversion rates and AOV. This was the best decision as my ads finally started to perform consistently and I was not stressed out and panicking about my next steps with my ads strategy.

To sum up, this post was written to remind my fellow entrepreneurs to reflect on their weaknesses, and to try to improve on them, turn them into your strengths and outsource the rest, so that you could focus on what you can do the best. I’m constantly getting requests to review the stores and the ads that the beginners are doing and I see that almost all of them follow the route that I described above and almost never get satisfactory results. Long gone are the days when you could just set up a store in one day, run ads and become profitable. Ecommerce has evolved so much and turned into an extremely competitive business, so, if you are not ready to put in your best effort and stand out from the rest, I would wholeheartedly suggest you to try and find another thing to do, because you are inevitably going to lose a lot of money and will not even learn from the price you paid.

If you have any questions, do not hesitate to drop a comment, and I’ll try to help out as best as I can. Wish you luck and determination.How to achieve consistency in e-commerce? (0 - $65k in 2 months)"

I know this sounds stupid, but hear me out. I am doing drop shipping, and I'm trying to sell a product that is supposed to make the customer crazy about it as soon as they see the fb ad. So my ideal customers are impulse buyers that filled with adrenaline buy my product without thinking twice.

My question is, if the user scrolls down and sees the Instagram logo at the end of the website, will they not get distracted, click on the Instagram link and never return to the store? If my goal is to sell, is it not a distraction to put a link to something else on the product page? Am I just overthinking it?

shopify,"Hi, im building a shopify store at the minute and I'm trying to do a design to put into my home page.

The design involves some simplified drawings of my products with a comparison of some other products, again with a simplified drawing.

I'm no artist so I don't plan on sketching them or anything.  I've actually found all the images I want on vector sites. 

The problem I'm having is that I want to open all my vector image files into a new page on photoshop, krita, gimp or similar.   And then group them all Together and make them the same size so I can have them equally spaced and sized for my little comparison design I'm doing.

I have no idea how to do this. Can anyone good with graphic design or these types of design software assist with this please??Trying to do a drawing for my shopify store"

Hi all

I have an issue that I have been having trouble finding an answer to. 

We sell online all year long, and ship from our office/warehouse.  We also sell at festivals that run 8-9 weekends long - we use the Shopify POS system for this. We sell at 6 of these a year.  When we setup the festivals, we take stock from our warehouse (leaving stock at the warehouse for online orders) and restock our booth every weekend.  The festival stock stays at the festival for the full run, and is not available for fulfilling online orders.  

Here is our issue.  We would like a way to setup our POS to only show what we have at the festival.  We sell a large variety of items and only take a small selection to the festivals, frequently things are rung up incorrectly at the festival which messes up our inventory, and we sometimes restock the wrong items. 

Another issue we have is this - we sometimes have stock of an item at a festival but not at the warehouse.  It appears to our online customers that we have stock of an item. but it's possible that all stock of that item has been taken to restock the festival.  Again - this causes issues with inventory, and customer satisfaction.  

Previously we have created duplicate items, and made them only available at a certain location and only on POS.  This worked fairly well but it's pretty time consuming.  I feel like there much be a better solution to this!

If you got this far, thanks for reading along and I hope I made sense!

Thanks in advance for any helpOnline store and temporary festival sales"

shopify,"Just starting out, a total beginner, and obviously, I'm researching and watching videos. One creator mentioned how naming your store something that has nothing to do with the product is a good idea as if the product fails, there's no need to buy another domain/Shopify account. For example, the name ""Nike"" has no direct correlation with sportswear. I just wanted to hear other people's opinions on this matter. I get how you can save money, but will I lose out on a lot of the learning process if I just recycle the same store design? Thanks!Shopify Store Names"

Essentially I will be drawing pictures of people, digital art , and i will have printed canvasses or posters delivered to the customer.

shopify,"I see lots of Shopify stores fail , many of which drop ship from China , where the sender usually has a ridiculous sounding name like Xiong, Ching Chong Chan, and the like

However, with most stores drop ship from China , hold no inventory, and have little risk, how can such stores fail if the risk is low?

Shopify is 29$ a month, say low ad spend at $100 a month

$129 a month minimum

Surely you can several items a month to cover the costs

shopify,"Hi Everyone, I have a problem with shopify currently and I seem to be the only in the internet with it. 

We have had Shopify working as our order management system since a few years ago. 

Everything is going as good as it could, the main issue we are currently facing which I can't seem to find a fix for is that some clients lose their carts randomly. 

I have a persistent cart App installed and it still happens. 

I'm trying to scour the internet regarding this issue but everything that I found is about actual cart abandonment but not about clients losing their carts. 

I'm aware of Shopify's 14 days cart retention but I have clients who have lost their cart after only 4-5 days. 

If any one has had the smae issue, how did you fix it. 

Thank you.Lost cart before checkout."
