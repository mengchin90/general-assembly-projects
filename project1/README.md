With the introduction of new format of the SAT in March 2016, the educational board are looking to improve the participation rate of SAT. The purpose of this report is to provide recommendations for areas that resources can be appropriately channeled so as to improve the participation rate in SAT.

## Conclusions and Recommendations
From our analysis and research, it can be seem that the most effective way to improve the participation rate is to providing greater accessibilty such as 'SAT School Day' which allow students to attempt the exam in their school on a school day. Additionally, by helping to cover the cost of SAT would also reduce the barrier.
<br/>
<br/> Another recommendation is to work with states to support a state wide mandate. This is evidence in the increase in participation from 2017 to 2018 in Colorado.
<br/>
<br/> These are some short term effective solutions to improve the participation rate. Moving forward, it can be seen that there is a negative correlation between student's results and participation rate as well as a negative correlation between SAT and ACT participation. This shows that student tend to just participate in either of the test and they would only participate in the exam if they would perform better. Hence, it is recommended to provide more preparation class for SAT in order to help increase the confident level of students to participate in the SAT.
